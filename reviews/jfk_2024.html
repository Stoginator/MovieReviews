    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>With 1991’s <cite>JFK</cite>, Oliver Stone popularized a three-hour, docu-drama filled with talking heads. To keep the characters with little screentime memorable, the talking heads tend to be famous actors. A deluge of dialogue delivery is the narrative propulsion. Consequential historical events provide the background. You can sense this well-constructed yet frenetic style being used in 2007’s <cite>Zodiac</cite>, 2013’s <cite>The Wolf of Wall Street</cite>, and 2023’s <cite>Oppenheimer</cite>. When done right, it makes for a spectacular experience; all these films are brimming with an energy. The director’s cut of <cite>JFK</cite> is three hours, twenty-five minutes – and never overstays its welcome in any scene.</p>

                    <p><cite>JFK</cite> gets its electric start by introducing John William’s stirring main theme: a loud drum line and dominating horns which merge with a full orchestra. Quick cuts reveal the relevant history of the early 1960s from Eisenhower’s farewell address, the hope of change in Kennedy’s 1960 presidential election, and his decisions as President relating to America’s military-industrial complex. It is absolutely riveting and necessary exposition.</p>

                    <p>Then, Stone transitions to the footage of November 22, 1963. We all know what is coming and the anxiety builds. A single gun is cocked and a single shot is fired. The pervading myth of Kennedy’s assassination is forged as we all know it. The remaining three hours of <cite>JFK</cite> are built upon reversing the audience’s belief in the original narrative, that Lee Harvey Oswald was not the sole assassin of Kennedy, or even an assassin at all.</p>

                    <p><cite>JFK</cite> is best viewed as narrative fiction, a tale presented as an historical epic, of one man versus the state. Disregarding the veracity of what happens onscreen and accepting it as an interpretation, not historical fact, is the way to experience maximum enjoyment. There is epic filmmaking skill on display with Oliver Stone’s vision and the cross-cutting between real historical footage and look-alike dramatized footage. Little nuggets of rarely noticed detail are placed at the right times. Throughout the film, doors slam with the echo of a gunshot multiple times, having a subconscious effect that fits in with the film’s viewpoint.</p>

                    <p>The audience is led into the perspective of New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), by showing how he envisions the six infamous seconds from when the first bullet was fired to the last one. If Garrison is wrong, we empathize with his conviction. If Garrison is right, we feel his shame that America’s government is not led by its people. Kevin Costner’s performance carries the film, with his obsessive desire for justice singed into our minds.</p>

                    <p><cite>JFK</cite> is beyond what a screenwriter can produce in the fictional realm. This level of information, a versatile supporting cast, and the subversion of one’s expectations – convincing the audience that there had to be multiple shooters firing seven bullets, instead of a single shooter using only three bullets – all converge to provide the climax.</p>

                    <p>However contested are the facts of JFK, two scenes sparked my skepticism. With Lou (Jay O. Sanders), his partner, Garrison visits the building in Dallas and peers through the window where Oswald supposedly took his shots. Garrison looks out the window and asks Lou, <q>Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?</q> For an assassination, it is the cleaner shot, and the viewpoint on Elm Street – with the sharp curve and an obscured line of sight – is much worse. Lou remarks, <q>This is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn’t do the shooting. Nobody could.</q></p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The next scene is the classic rundown in the Washington Mall where Garrison meets Mr. X (Donald Sutherland). It is unclear where the origins of this setup derive from, but it feels like an obligatory cliché in a film where the antagonist is the United States government; it is seen again with Tom Cruise in 1993’s The Firm. Mr. X lays out the entire conspiracy as seen from inside the intelligence agencies, remarking that only four hours after the shooting, he picked up a newspaper in New Zealand with information about Kennedy’s assassination, including Oswald’s full biography and photo. How was that possible so early after the event, if the event itself was not a premeditated attempt by the intelligence community? If this is true, it is quite perplexing.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the continued mystery of Kennedy's assassination, what Garrison discusses in his lengthy ending monologue actually came to pass: <q>It may become a generational affair with questions passed down father to son, mother to daughter. But someday, somewhere, someone may find out the damn truth.</q> Garrison faced the issue of abundant circumstantial evidence, where he could only offer grave speculation.</p>

                    <p>Sixty-one years later, all the witnesses, all the case files, and all of the American people’s interest in this matter has ossified. The facts of that day seem unrecoverable, lost to history. Suppose there was a conspiracy led by the intelligence community and abetted by Dallas police, then they clearly won this round. Today, war is the biggest government-funded business in America with $800 billion in spending, ten times what it was in 1991, and getting bigger every year with a seemingly limitless ceiling. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-fails-audit-sixth-year-row-2023-11-16/">The Pentagon cannot complete a full audit.</a> Where does this money even go?</p>

                    <p>The intent of <cite>JFK</cite> does not seem to be that it must convince us of the entire coup d’état prophecy of Jim Garrison. It is simpler: the American people have to ask tough questions of our government – and Jim Garrison was one man who did. JFK is a profile in courage and a message film, as Kevin Costner looks into the camera and says, <q>It’s up to you.</q> If Garrison was right about even a fraction of what he claimed, then we are doomed to let it happen again.</p>
