    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Some sequels have no purpose of being. Their story is inconsequential, the characters are rinsed off and reused, and any sort of narrative propulsion is missing. <cite>Toy Story 3</cite> had a perfect ending sending both the characters and the audience off with a truly emotional good-bye. Or so we thought....</p>

                    <p><cite>Toy Story 4</cite> deserved to be made. It’s a story featuring our favorite characters that we did not know needed to be told. Everyone is back: Woody, Buzz, Jess, Bullseye, the Potatoheads, Rex, Hamm, Slinky, and all of Bonnie’s toys. The team at Pixar knows that we want another trip with this amazing group of characters. But, most of all, the hardest condition to fulfill is for the story to be emotionally engaging. This film is Woody’s. Out of all the characters, the events in this film cause Woody to grow in ways that make us glow and sadden. </p>

                    <p>There is no question that this film is Pixar’s best looking feature. The lighting, the vast environments, and the beauty of each toy (plastic, fur, and porcelain) is showcased to create the most cinematic, animated film yet. Even the cinematography is loaded with pans and tracking shots enhancing the drama and investing us into this fictitious world. It’s unbelievably beautiful which makes us all the more responsive to its emotional pull.</p>

                    <p>I want to know how Pixar crafts the most moving pictures. Within the first ten minutes, I was on the verge of bursting into tears. That is a mastery of craft as well as an awareness of the audience’s investment in these characters. The connection, or the bond, between the audience and the characters is very apparent. Pixar does not reach out for sentimentality; instead, they resort to storytelling leaving the weight of each character to function as the sentiment. Right until the very end, I had only suspicions of where the story was going. But, the brilliance comes from affording the audience moments of reflection after a cacophony of thematic twists and turns. When these characters face a decision point, we are right there with them. Not to mention, Randy Newman’s fantastic music has been with us for a long time. It is all used to elevate the picture and make you soar. That’s something special.</p>

                    <p>There is no true villain in this film as there has been in each previous installment. Rather, the constant enemy is an omnipresent force of nature: time, which also speaks to the exceptional longevity of this franchise. After twenty-four years, “Toy Story 4” stands out in a series of truly great films. It does not feel like an ending for these characters; rather, it is a new beginning. And, that’s okay, for after some tears, the film brought a smile to my face. Pixar achieved a nearly impossible task and sent us to the moon and back. And for that, I am eternally grateful.</p>
