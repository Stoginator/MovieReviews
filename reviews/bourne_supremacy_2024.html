    				<p>If <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> is a story about love, then <cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite> is a story about grief. The impetus of this film is a tragic death. As their car violently crashes into water, Jason tries to revive Marie. He is a problem-solver, but, even with all his training, he can’t escape this one. The sunlight barely penetrates underwater, producing a green-tinted darkness. Marie gently floats out of view, leaving Jason stunned. The moment haunts us.</p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">The final image of Marie (Franka Potente) as she floats into the darkness.</figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The green tint codes the remainder of the film, reminding us of what Jason experienced. For the first time, we hear <a href="https://youtu.be/p0ZOknknVE4?si=M-CYq5dfewCUNLCS&t=59">Marie’s theme</a>, a soft tune that echoes and reverberates throughout the soundscape like loss does in our lives. Neither character can breathe underwater, and neither can we. It is a gut-wrenching death that resonates enough to motivate the rest of the film. What happens when a lost soul, a killer in another life, loses the only person he knows and the only meaning he has?</p>

                    <p>There is some dramatic irony. Bourne thinks that the people running Treadstone, the program that created him, are responsible for Marie’s death. We know that is not true. The inherent tension that pervades the film is born out of character. In the search for justice, will Jason revert to becoming the ruthless assassin he once was? For that is the choice. Will he succumb to the dark forces that created him or seek the light?</p>

                    <p>In 2002’s <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite>, writers Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron scripted an action film that was more focused on characters than explosions. This time around, director Paul Greengrass entered the collaboration with writer Tony Gilroy, bringing his innovative style of filmmaking techniques to bear – and the same emphasis on character.</p>

                    <p>Every cut matters in <cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite>. Even though they are speedily brought on and launched off screen, there are no frivolous cuts. Each one delivers new information to the audience. Many action films have tried to emulate the ferocious style of <cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite>. What is missing from them?</p>

                    <p>In <cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite>, the purpose of quick cuts and shaky camerawork is to immerse the audience in Jason’s perspective. Bourne is constantly checking sightlines, looking for exits, and planning his next step. With the help of an illustrious Matt Damon and fantastic camera placements, we see the gears turning in his mind. When the pressure is most intense, his analysis becomes instinct, ratcheting faster. Every input – every cut – changes the potential action of his character.</p>

                    <p>In the Moscow car chase, it means left or right, pedal to the metal or slam the brakes. Reducing the average length of shots makes the film more participatory and has a strong basis in character. Most importantly, the action sequences are also <em>fun</em>, after the stomach-wrenching tension exits stage left. Every time I revisit <cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite>, I will find something new. Like a wonderful magic trick, it is bloody hard to do well.</p>

                    <p>This style is imitated in other films, but for the wrong reasons. Often, it has no grounding in story or character and purely exists for aesthetic reasons, creating a hollow sense of tension where there is none. For the most part, it just confuses the audience, negotiating a passive viewing rather than involving the audience in a character’s decision-making process.</p>

                    <p>Everyone from the actors to the second unit came onto this film with their best game. A few familiar faces return like Nicky (Julia Stiles) and Abbott (Brian Cox), but I was most taken with the newcomers: Pam Landy (Joan Allen) and Kirill (Karl Urban). John Powell returns with a score that tops <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> in every way, with tone-setting music like <cite>The Drop</cite>, <cite>Funeral Pyre</cite>, and <cite>To The Roof</cite> while introducing themes in <cite>Goa</cite>, <cite>New Memories</cite>, and <cite>Atonement</cite> that carry the emotional arc of the film.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Bourne Supremacy</cite> is about a character seeking redemption. The foot chases and car chases are expertly made sequences, but the purpose behind the action stands tall. Without Marie to guide him, all Jason wants to do is find a way to purify his soul and honor her memory. The ending is ironic, yet deeply moving: a reformed assassin comes to terms with the loss he has inflicted on others, atoning for his sins. In doing so, he begins to process the grief he holds.</p>
