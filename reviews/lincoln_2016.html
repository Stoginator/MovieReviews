    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Steven Spielberg's historical character study is about one of America's most influential presidents and person, too. Herein, Spielberg and screenwriter, Tony Kushner, have crafted a movie together that is as dense as a collapsing black hole. Lincoln is filled to the brim with information and dialogue about the last four months of Lincoln's presidency, one that is very eventful and not to be taken lightly.</p>

                    <p>The <cite>13th Amendment</cite>, the Civil War, and Lincoln's family are topics and people that the film truly examines in-depth. The film showcases Lincoln himself as a man of strength, compassion, and determination. While at some points, his actions are ambivalent, maybe even impetuous, in order to pass the 13th Amendment, Lincoln's motivation as shown through his dialogue and actions is that slavery is unjust and cruel, and no matter what it takes, it must be abolished. </p>

                    <p>Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Academy Award for his performance and its flawlessness in depicting President Abraham Lincoln. One of the true strokes of genius with Spielberg in this film is that he never commonly offers up close-ups of Lewis, only in times of pain, determination, contemplation, or even lightness. Yes, Mr. Lincoln is shown as a comedian of the highest order sharing with us his "stories" throughout the film. It is even shown of how much intelligence he had, speaking about Euclid's Law of Equality as a metaphor for race equality, something regarded by Lincoln as an axiom. Lewis offers these to us with raw, real, and beautiful perfection.</p>

                    <p>Tony Kushner's screenplay is also stunning in its own right. He has managed to tell the story of Lincoln and his family while simultaneously explain the events regarding the Thirteenth Amendment and the Civil War. Already, this movie must be so full of information, but Kushner made it work, and not just barely, but spectacularly. Lincoln's dialogue is beautiful, bullet-stopping, and all-encompassing. He puts what seems like politics at the time into history in the moment. Lincoln's genius allows Kushner to expand his character beyond the screen and through time.</p>

                    <p>With Lincoln being a Spielberg film, it is a truism now that John Williams is on board, too. This is most likely one of the subtlest scores Williams has made, only coming in when its full impact will be appreciated and noted. In fact, when the score does the play, it is hushed a bit, but it accomplishes wonders in moments when the film soars. Williams is principally responsible for expanding the sound stage as the film is crafted on dialogue. </p>

                    <p>I hope <cite>Lincoln</cite>'s greatness isn't weighed down by Spielberg's legacy.</p>
