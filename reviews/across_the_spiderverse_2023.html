					<p><cite>Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</cite> is the ultimate kids movie. This film does not spoon-feed the details; to catch them, it encourages participating in the movie by meeting the audience half-way through its animation, which deserves to be picked apart frame-by-frame. Many times, you have to dig through each shot and assemble the pieces to learn what a character is thinking and how they are feeling - in ways that live-action films cannot replicate.
					</p>
					<p>With one of the most original movie scores since 2022’s <cite>The Batman</cite>, full character themes that act upon each other, and a sonic intensity that captures the moment, composer Daniel Pemberton has crafted the best score in recent memory. Every voice actor brings their A-game. Best-in-class animation, voice acting, and writing help bring the audience into a world with such clarity that we must surrender ourselves to the picture. This film is a great cultural service because it is teaching our future moviegoers how to watch movies.

					<p>I would be hard-pressed to remember a prologue so jam-packed with exposition, while sustaining an emotional tension. After the most memorable opening logos, a swell of music brings us into Gwen’s world for round two. Gwen’s headspace is animated into the picture so naturally that her unfortunately common Spider story feels fresh once again. Her father’s pursuit for Spider-Woman is not uncharted territory, but when he discovers his own daughter in the suit, we are now placed into his mind. On my first viewing, the moment held such gravity that I was unable to decipher the changing backgrounds. The colors of Captain Stacy’s surroundings help the audience tune into his shock and decision-making process: do I let my daughter go or arrest Spider-Woman? Upon my second and third viewings, I discovered the warm red and orange correspond to his feelings for Gwen and the solid blue and black correspond to his role as a police officer. Two new Spiders render his decision to arrest Gwen futile, but the decision was made. Gwen chooses to run away with her new colleagues. A second outburst of music captures the feeling of a family split in half and ends the prologue.</p>
					
					<blockquote class="section-quote">"I hope I didn't ice your game, man."</blockquote>
					
					<p>Miles Morales is in a quandary. Separated from his friends “who left town,” the weight of being the one and only Spider-Man has affected his schooling and caused his parents to wonder what is happening in his head. Can he tell his parents about his affliction and his duty? Much comedy and much emotion comes from the trio’s dynamic. The stakes of the story come from knowing how invested the characters are in each other. Spiderverse avoids all of the clichés by doing its own thing. When Gwen takes Miles on a very enjoyable, unannounced date, that provides an excuse, albeit a weak one. This leads to a particularly heartwarming scene occurs between Rio and Miles: she gives Miles the strength that helps him make the hard choices to come - and, in many ways, Rio is talking to us too.</p>

					<blockquote class="section-quote">"Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go."</blockquote>

					<p>Two alarming villains confront Miles. First is The Spot, a “villain of the week” that pulls a head-fake on the characters and audience and becomes Mile’s arch-nemesis. His essential nature is to destroy everything that Miles’ holds dear: look for him to do some major damage. Miguel O’Hara is Spider-Man 2099 and a believer in “canon-event” destiny: what happens to all Spider-Men must happen or the entire universe will crumble. A vision that Mile’s father dies at the hands of The Spot tests Mile’s reality. Mile's desire to change this outcome would also test the very fabric of reality according to O'Hara.</p>
					<p>This film asks us the biggest questions we know of: who writes our destinies? Can we change them? Is there an unalterable series of “canon events” that guide our lives? If the moral of the first film was “Anyone can be Spider-Man,” then the moral of the second film is “Never forget where you came from” - not the one that was expected. Likely, the moral of the third film will be: “All of us have the power to shape our destiny … if we try hard enough.”</p>

					<blockquote class="section-quote">"Nah. Imma do my own thing."</blockquote>

					<p>Will Miles be able to save his father from The Spot or Miguel O’Hara? The essential truth of Miles Morales is that his destiny is his own. He never chose to be bitten by Earth 42’s spider, so his alteration of the canon is not his fault. But, at the same time, the essential truth of The Spot is he will command a sacrifice from Miles. And, Miguel O’Hara will not stop his search until Miles relents. How this story resolves itself is a hard question. As the Joker says in 2008’s <cite>The Dark Knight</cite>, “What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?”</p>
					<p>Each main character (Miles, Gwen, Miguel, and Peter B.) faces obstacles, conflicts - whatever you name it - in keeping their family together. If you knew that keeping your family together threatened the stability of the universe, what would you do? Sacrifice the ones you love to save the countless others? <cite>Spiderverse</cite> is not afraid to throw its hero into fraught and bleak situations. How the hero reacts is the true story. Having watched this movie with packed houses of kids, teenagers, and adults, it was an awesome experience in seeing what lands and what does not (the answer: almost nothing in the right conditions). <cite>Across the Spiderverse</cite> is a great piece of mass entertainment. At the same time, it is also teaching Earth’s youngsters what great entertainment is.

					<p class="section-quote"><cite>Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</cite><br>has earned commendation as one of my favorite films of all time.</p>

					<i><u>Note</u>: I saw this film three times in theaters. Watching it in a Dolby Cinema, a standard auditorium, and a Cinemark XD screen helped me understand that the format is very important. A Dolby Cinema with the audio turned up loud induces a similarly massive response. A standard screen where the dialogue is sometimes inaudible blunts the impact of this great film. <strong>Advice for the future: where possible, please turn the volume up when watching this film at home!</strong></i>
