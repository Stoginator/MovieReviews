    				<p>Halfway through <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite>, there is a framing of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and William Hale (Robert DeNiro) sneakily taking turns to peer through a doorway. The two are peering at Henry Roan (William Belleau), a young member of the Osage Tribe, sitting peacefully by their fireplace. Behind their guest’s back, Burkhart and Hale whisper about how long he must be kept alive until they are eligible to claim the insurance policy on his life. They are hunters zoning in on their prey, but there is something more sinister at play. </p>

                    <p>Henry has known Hale for as long as he can remember. There is a deep trust between them. How can Hale, who helped this young Osage grow up as one of his own, execute a plan to murder him? <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> is disturbing because it is about an evil in men that knows no bounds. No shared value or belief - no call to friendship, community, or family - can save you when your life stands in the way of wealth.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"The Osage are the finest, wealthiest, and most beautiful people on God’s Earth."<br><br>– William Hale</blockquote>

                    <p>In the 1920s, Hale, Burkhart, and other conspirators were involved in scores of premeditated murders, known by the Osage community as “The Reign of Terror.” <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> splits its time between their machinations and the lived experience of Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), an Osage woman.</p>

                    <p>One day, Ernest, a cab operator in the town center, picks up Mollie and begins to drive her around during her errands. An acquaintanceship morphs into a friendship and blossoms into a marriage – an increasingly common phenomenon in Osage Nation at the time. Non-Osage members were motivated to marry into Osage families to own headrights and receive shares of the oil money flooding into the community. Though, as the film depicts, there is a remarkable and genuine romance between Mollie and Ernest.</p>

                    <p>Mollie’s joy is short-lived. The murders of the Osage are occurring more frequently; the deaths are amassing a greater psychological toll. Unthinkable events shatter Mollie’s reality as one of her three sisters dies by poison. Another paralyzing scene occurs by a creek. Hearing the unfortunate news, a mass of settlers has gathered. With Ernest beside her, Mollie slowly makes her way through the parting crowd – feeling like a stranger in her own land, dreading the most devastating news about her sister.</p>

                    <p>As Mollie’s family is hunted one-by-one, there is a montage from her perspective. She is unable to recognize her home, which has become filled with new settlers who envy her status and come to Osage Nation because they desire it. These European Americans feel a <em>claim</em> to the tribe’s enormous wealth. This entitlement is so built into the culture of new settlers that their right to take what is not theirs is never questioned.</p>
                </section>
                <figure class="inline-photo">
                    <img src="../assets/review_photos/killers_flower_moon_mollie.webp">
                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">Lily Gladstone stars as Mollie Kyle. She gazes at newcomers to her land, suspecting a growing evil.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>In a vivid scene during the montage, Ernest and Mollie walk next to a train as its passengers deboard in great numbers. Robbie Robertson’s deep bass strumming on the track <cite>Heartbeat Theme</cite> fills the space with anxiety. Steam clouds the view in the distance. In point-blank range, the new arrivals stare at them walking in the opposite direction. Mollie comes to realize that she is next.</p>

                    <p>Mollie is the conscience of the film. The trauma of a tribe is carried on her shoulders. While the cast features DiCaprio and DeNiro, there was no doubt in my mind that Lily Gladstone had the most resonant performance of the film. For the audience, Gladstone realizes the two-sided relationship of Mollie and Ernest: her real love for him and her initial reluctance to accept his complicity.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“These deaths seem more like an epidemic than bad luck to me.”<br><br>– Tom White, FBI Agent</blockquote>

                    <p><cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> is a film about the contradictory nature of relationships. How can a loving uncle order his nephew to betray his own family? How can a loving husband stay quiet about the murders of his sisters-in-law, reluctantly poison his wife, and believe he stayed true to his covenant? How does a wife, crippled by grief and her growing suspicion of her husband’s involvement in her sisters’ deaths, continue to love him? These relationships evade easy definition and feel deeply truthful in the film. </p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps the most Scorsese-ian question can be found in <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite>: How can men, whose actions are clearly evil, continue to believe in their righteousness? Every Scorsese movie is an honest investigation of such questions, but one should never expect any answers.</p>

                    <p>In the pursuit of these questions, <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> weighs heavily on the mind. I did not know this story. Scorsese pulls no punches by ensuring the telling is not sanitized. None of the horrible events become normalized. Over the course of a viewing, Scorsese’s other films desensitize us to criminally bad behavior but, in <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite>, he does the opposite. Every act of violence is added trauma. The cumulative impact of the murders is harrowing.</p>

                    <p>When you leave the theater after the film concludes, the weight of its story remains. I struggled to grasp the nature of Ernest and Mollie’s relationship – a great paradox between love and evil. Unlike 2019’s <cite>The Irishman</cite>, <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> is not about the reckoning of the characters’ souls, or the price they pay for their actions. The hard truth is those men never did.</p>

                    <p>How can a country that boldly proclaims equality for all also, in the same breath, fail to live up to that ideal? Scorsese points the camera at us - towards the contradictions in our own souls and our society. While I felt a burning sense of injustice that most of these murderers were set free, paroled, or even pardoned, I also dealt with a great unease with my lack of familiarity with this story as an American. Why don't more of us know this story?</p>

                    <p>In that sense, Martin Scorsese has brought a dark piece of American history into the light. This was a little-known story of unimaginable trauma and havoc caused by the systematic murders of the Osage community. Now, <cite>Killers of the Flower Moon</cite> is an essential story in the American canon.</p>
