    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>In April of 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed homosexuality as “a sociopathic personality disturbance” and, a year later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower banned gay people from working for the federal government citing “security risks” (“LBGTQ Rights”). Kenneth Anger, an experimental filmmaker whose 1963 film <cite>Scorpio Rising</cite> explicitly explored homoerotic acts, was sued for publicly premiering his film (Grady). Then, as the anti-gay movement grew in public support, Maryland’s state legislature banned same-sex marriage in 1973. In the span of two decades, homophobia transformed from an undercurrent in American society to a perceptible wave of angst that became mainstream as it was recognized at the highest levels of American government. </p>

                    <p>Near the turn of the decade in 1990, filmmakers began fostering a provocative, avant-garde place for motion pictures strictly focusing on gay identity; this movement garnered its own term: “New Queer Cinema” (Daisies). Most, if not all, of these films were produced by independent companies and, with the exception of a few high-profile film festivals, never gained significant mainstream viewership and achieved critical success (Piontek). Historically, there was only a niche market demand for films centered around gay characters (Rich). Yet in 2004, Focus Features, an independent production company, green-lit a feature-length film about an intimate love story starring two popular, leading actors with a relatively expensive budget of fourteen million dollars (“Brokeback”). Against conventional wisdom, the film was marketed to mainstream audiences, rather than targeting niche groups (Piontek). Ang Lee’s film, Brokeback Mountain, observes the ebbs and flows in a relationship between two ranchers over the course of twenty years beginning in 1963 – a particularly dangerous period for gay people. By humanizing the main characters, <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> allows a mainstream audience to empathize with their psychological trauma, reconcile with the “gay experience,” and unmake the cultural mythologies surrounding gay people. </p>

                    <p><cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> opens with the sounds of a steady breeze and a gentle, acoustic guitar over the sight of rolling hills. The audience observes the film’s central protagonist, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger), jumping out of a semi-truck and then waiting in front of a trailer. Some time passes and a cowboy rolls into a dirt parking lot with a rattling pickup truck: Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). Wearing his hat, he stops his car, exits, and stands facing Ennis. Jack catches a glimpse of Ennis for a few seconds before looking down and concealing his face. As Jack’s back is turned, Ennis reciprocates; a few more stolen glances transpire between the two. In the span of a few moments, director Ang Lee consciously reveals every tool in his toolbox – every mechanism that will be used to carry the story and the characters forward.</p>

                    <p>Lee guides the audience through the film with silent subjectivity. By distantly rendering the performances of the entire cast, Lee enhances the raw emotion of the story by letting the characters and their dialogue stand in their own truth. In doing so, the traditional role of a director as a lens of guidance is deconstructed to present a viewpoint that feels objective to the audience. Essentially, Lee defers to the audience in order to let their judgement supersede his own vision. The film’s sound design strongly conveys this practice. With the exception of the film’s score, every sound effect is diegetic and, therefore, authentic in order to recreate a realistic presentation of the environments in Wyoming. Gustavo Santaolalla’s score is sparsely heard, yet tonally effective because Lee prioritizes its use in a few key scenes to suggest ideas and symbolism, rather than emotions.</p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text"><cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>: Gustavo Santaolalla's “Riding Horses” accompanies Jack and Ennis along an idyllic horseback trail on Brokeback Mountain. Presenting a quiet rendition of solitude and continuing the visual symbolism of the environment, the track is used to emphasize what could be – the possibilities in a kinder world.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The only musical accent that coincides with the emotion seen on-screen serves as the outro of the film. “The Wings” escalates in volume as Ennis opens his closet to see his own bloodied shirt, Jack’s jean jacket, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain – the everlasting representation of Jack’s hope for what could have been. The film cuts to a close-up of Ennis in tears as he mumbles, <q>Jack, I swear.</q> By creating lines of emotional logic through combinations of video and sound that stretch across the film, Lee elicits self-generated sympathy from an audience that, historically, has been reluctant to commiserate with the adversity faced by gay people.</p>

                    <p>Cumulatively, these choices reinforce a trait that is found in the film’s central character: Ennis’s rejection of his identity. As he views the world, his sense of self-identity is swept up in the traditional social mores of being a father by financially providing for his family which leaves no room for introspection. What Ennis fears most is becoming the very thing that his father explicitly and violently condemned. More significantly, through his experiences, Ennis learns to hate himself.</p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text"><cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>: At home, Ennis is a fraction of the man he can be - constantly awaiting his next getaway with Jack. Somehow aware of Ennis’s anxiety behind the wall, his wife, Alma, sits next to their daughter with a melancholy expression.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>As Jake Gyllenhaal explains the dynamic between the main characters, “This is about two people desperately looking for love [and] to be loved,” but their love conflicts with their sense of being (“The Hollywood”). Even through the periods of loneliness, denial, and loss in between their excursions, the time that Jack and Ennis spend together atop Brokeback Mountain grows to define their individual characters.</p>

                    <p>The continued secrecy and psychological trauma of their relationship affects each man in different ways. Both men marry women as they were raised to do, but neither finds fulfillment in their traditional relationships. In a moment of great disappointment, Ennis’s female lover, Cassie, remarks that, <q>Girls don’t fall in love with fun!</q> Without either character realizing their own romantic tendencies, her statement reveals how limited both characters see relationships with women; their true commitment lies with each other, but that fact is not obvious or easy to acknowledge. Jack leaves the United States in order to satisfy his sexual desires and expresses his anger that Ennis will not commit to their relationship or verbally admit that one even exists. Conversely, Ennis begins to violently repress his nature by threatening his ex-wife and rejecting Jack’s embrace. Holding on to a condemnable relationship in the hope that it may succeed brings Ennis too much misery. </p>

                    <p>In a contentious, verbal argument, Jack pleads with Ennis to accept their relationship by expressing the pain of his suppressed desires: <q>You have no idea how bad it gets.</q></p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text"><cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>: Standing in front of Brokeback Mountain, Jack confronts Ennis to tell him that their semi-annual excursions are not enough for him. The beautiful vista represents Jack’s vision of happiness for them. Yet, Ennis lingers behind, ever doubtful about taking this “thing,” as he calls their relationship throughout the film, any further.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Ennis replies with a sorrowful, half-spoken cry, <q>It’s because of you, Jack, that I’m like this. I’m nothin’. I’m nowhere.</q> In moments of anger, Ennis and Jack imply that their relationship was a mistake – an impossible aim; yet, their limited contentment is derived from moments of solitude together atop Brokeback Mountain. Through an exploration of character, the film’s reliance on universal expressions of shared love, loneliness, and grief allows mainstream audiences to follow a socially forbidden and secretive bond. In practice, the main characters’ homosexuality becomes secondary to their visceral experiences of basic emotions. Through a gradual escalation of the main characters’ relationship, the film modernizes the idea of who a cowboy can be – nullifying cinema’s previous, exclusive definition seen in decades of westerns. <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> features conversations and situations that most people in America have never encountered yet contains elements that make them feel strikingly familiar and poignant. Because of this, a previously misunderstood way of life becomes accessible to mainstream audiences.</p>

                    <p><cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> uses the story of its characters to confront ideology. Jeffrey Nealon writes that ideology is a “group of intertwining beliefs” creating “cultural consensus or knowledge” that does not need to be justified. The film does not present an attitude towards the hardships faced by gay people in a hostile society; it has no message to deliver. Its main objective is to present the high price that two people had to pay in order to embrace their love for each other. The social stigmas that Ennis and Jack combat are never directly referenced, but their presence is confronted by both characters and consciously understood by the viewer. Responding to Jack’s proposal to maintain a ranch together, Ennis, fearing retribution from others, rejects his challenge to the status-quo remarking, <q>If you can’t fix it, Jack, you’ve got to stand it.</q> The effects of these stigmas on the protagonists are so significant that Ennis could not accept his identity until Jack’s death; it took the greatest loss possible for Ennis to realize that he was not being true to his love for another person. The impact of <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> lies in the realization that the social constructs around how gay people are treated had not changed twenty years later when the film released in 2005. Remarkably, the film never questions the prevailing beliefs around gay people. The ideology of the era is simply shown through the characters as unquestioned, standard practice, and the film leads the audience themselves to question or condemn common thought and judgement.</p>

                    <p>Unlike the films during the late 1960s like <cite>They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?</cite> which embraces an unnerving tone by deconstructing American values through social commentary, <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>’s emotional thrust is derived from depicting characters as they exist – with no interpretive strings from the film attached. As Harper Lee's beloved character, Atticus Finch, says in her novel, <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>, <q>You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb in his skin and walk around in it.</q> <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> transports mainstream audiences into a familiar world with familiar faces, but through an unfamiliar perspective that enables them to experience life from another point of view. In the process, the performances of an ensemble cast, a tragic story, and subtle directorial vision culminate to produce a film with the ability to shift attitudes on how gay people are thought about and treated, simply because the audience wills it so. The powerful question that naturally arises from the film is “Isn’t their expression of love equal to mine?” </p>
