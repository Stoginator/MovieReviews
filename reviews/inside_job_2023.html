    				<p>Charles Ferguson’s monumental 2010 film is the first in an essential cinematic trilogy about modern-day Wall Street. The other two films, 2013’s <cite>The Wolf of Wall Street</cite> and 2016’s <cite>The Big Short</cite>, bring star-studded casts and darting scripts to illuminate the singular excesses of America’s famous financial hub.</p>

                    <p><cite>Inside Job</cite> is a much rawer experience - stripped of the scale of Hollywood dramas and placed firmly into real conversations with real individuals who contributed to the 2008 financial crisis or were around it. With Matt Damon as the narrator, <cite>Inside Job</cite> is a dramatic explainer that arms its viewers with its investigation into how contorted and risky financial instruments created a housing bubble so large that it almost blew up the world economy. Even with fifteen years of distance, this film makes one of the scariest moments in recent American history feel just as alarming as it must have felt in 2008.</p>

                    <p>Though, Ferguson omits an obvious, yet crucial point in the conversation about reforming banks. Access to credit from our financial institutions is how bridges got built, how cities were erected, and how people and businesses can continue to innovate. Banks have existed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States">the beginning of the United States</a> and continue to hold a large role in American life. This crisis happened because the people behind the wheel at banks all over the world were allowed to thrash the normal operating procedures of the system in order to strike larger profits.</p>

                    <p>The first five minutes of the film explore Iceland, where it sets the stage for the audience with a microcosm of the larger story. There is a <cite>Koyaanisqatsi</cite>-esque montage of an idyllic land. Iceland is depicted as a democratic society with clean energy, low crime, and “end-of-history” status that somehow had an annual gross domestic product of $13 billion and bank losses of $100 billion in 2008. As the crisis began, unemployment rose. Deposits and savings disappeared. Regulators had abandoned their posts to work for banks. An Icelandic professor asks us,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>But this is a universal problem. In New York, you have the same problem, right?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Assembling a litany of financial experts on both sides of the crisis, Ferguson meticulously guides the audience step-by-step in answering, <q>How did the backbone of the American economy almost destroy itself?</q> It is a simple story: Ferguson tries to prove that the banks were systematically unleashed from the decades of norms. </p>

                    <p>Anyone that wanted a house got an adjustable-rate mortgage that was sliced-and-diced into crazy concoctions of fraudulently rated loans. The banks sold these “highly rated” loan packages to customers who believed they were retirement-grade investments. Then, the banks created insurance for themselves that gained value when their junk loan packages depreciated. As their profits ballooned to unprecedented levels, more junk went out the door. A feedback loop was created that stimulated behavior unworthy of a central pillar of the American economy. As clients lost billions, banks made billions.</p>

                    <p>As the film pivots to America, many of the people involved in this broken system declined to be interviewed - from the regulators who enabled it to the C-suite executives who approved it. The director and the interviewer behind the camera, Charles Ferguson, spared no preparation, armed with immense knowledge of the financial gamesmanship played by Wall Street. Ferguson never veers into logical fallacies by attacking someone’s character. Rather, he has studied his case like a great lawyer preparing for a trial.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes, Ferguson’s interviews shed light into the psyche of those who engineered the crisis. They seem honest to themselves about what they did. Moreover, they are not ashamed of their actions. You see the different reactions to his questions as the interviewees all think “Who are <i>you</i> to judge me?” In response to a series of polite, yet biting questions, one academic expresses his vitriol; another is obviously expressing silent criticism with a smirk.</p>

                    <p>Clearly, those involved rationalize their actions, believing that anyone in their shoes would have done the same thing. Indeed, they have a point. Imagine you miraculously created a faucet of money? At first, you embellish the faucet to increase how much money flows out. Then, you learn that every minute the faucet ran, a home was foreclosed and the family inside was thrown out onto the streets? Would you turn it off?</p>

                    <p>As we learn, many of the people who enabled bad decision-making launched themselves into golden thrones. Ferguson paints a history of financial deregulation in America that began in the 1980s. Academics with “expertise” persuaded Congress to renege on rules meant to protect Americans at the bank. Regulators revised rules to let banks make more dangerous decisions in the name of “free markets” and business autonomy. The few dissenters were systematically rooted out. Industry lobbyists, academics, and regulators all shared the same North Star; in a spectacular failure of American bureaucracy, these three groups coalesced into one. For their service to the industry, members of this deregulation group left government and took board seats with generous paydays at the companies they were supposed to oversee. It is the type of complicit behavior that gives government service a bad name.</p>

                    <p>When the ruin began to manifest itself outside of the P&L sheets, America’s financial institutions took no responsibility for the certainty of havoc that they had sown. Banks knew they could hold access to credit hostage and cripple the economy. These essential services that banks provide could not be lost.</p>

                    <p>Because of the decades-long deregulation, individual banks had become so massive and so interdependent with the economy that Congress could only save the whole system – good parts and bad - or let even more harm befall Americans. They earned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">a quick $700 billion bail-out</a> that was part of a series of federal packages that doubled the national debt. In the end, the taxpayers, not the deregulation group, paid the price for terrible decisions. It is one of the greatest scams ever successfully perpetrated on the American people.</p>

                    <p>Fifteen years after from the crisis, <cite>Inside Job</cite> illustrates Americans’ lack of faith in power brokers. It is clear that many Americans feel that the cornerstones of power in our country - our universities, corporations, media, and government - are all undeserving of trust.</p>

                    <p>The emotional reality of <cite>Inside Job</cite> makes it abundantly clear that there is a direct trace from the Great Recession to Americans’ disillusionment in our critical institutions. The regulators at agencies who changed the rules for greed to run rampant got away. The academics, who crafted the laws that deregulated the banks, are thriving. The bankers, who sold fraudulently rated junk, insured themselves against its failure, and lauded their “right” to sell junk to clients, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/03/19/news/economy/bonus_tax/index.htm">made billions in bonuses direct from American taxpayers</a> - and thought it was their money to keep. Some lawmakers played political theater over the mere mention of recouping these bonuses as if we, taxpayers, should reward the bankers who blew up the economy. </p>

                    <p>Nothing anyone did was strictly illegal, but, given the consequences of their actions, shouldn’t it have been? The 2008 financial crisis erased trillions of dollars in retirement savings, eliminated millions of jobs, and caused thousands of deaths of despair. How could they create this mess and not be punished? There is a root here to the anger and toxicity that pervades American politics.</p>

                    <p>To those who have trust remaining in our institutions, the idea that presidents, regulators, and academics colluded with Wall Street to let the best and brightest “financial engineers” run amok is a shock. It feels like the Great Recession was a paradox. How could these “smart” people let a series of bad actions escalate to the point of destruction? How could the people monitoring the banks abandon their duties? How can these most un-American actions also be part of the American fabric? <cite>Inside Job</cite> tells us that this American story continues a thread that has been here from the beginning: the destructive nature of greed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our institutions do not operate by themselves. They are run by people. The financial services industry is not inherently bad; they have been and can be a vehicle for great societal progress. But, when the incentive structures change and the consequences for myopic behavior are almost non-existent, people are reliable actors. Instead of protecting the people that they serve, institutions created an abusive relationship with the public. You cannot cause harm, refuse to admit wrongdoing, and then expect everyone to pretend like things are normal afterwards. Institutions would do well to adhere to the advice of Warren Buffet:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it."</blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Dispute what you may: <cite>Inside Job</cite> bears a close proximity to the emotional truth of the 2008 financial crisis. Weaving together the historical narrative with the present-day reality piece-by-piece, the film inspires a conversation about the limits of institutions to do the right thing. As a documentary, <cite>Inside Job</cite> is a great public service, meant to relay the hard truths to Americans about the terrible decisions that were made in plain sight.</p>
