    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>America needs more movies about itself and the people in it. 2023’s <cite>American Fiction</cite> joins a growing lineage of work like 2017’s <cite>Master of None</cite>, 2018’s <cite>Green Book</cite>, 2021’s <cite>Mare of Easttown</cite>, and 2023’s <cite>The Curse</cite>, to name just a few. Therefore, it is not surprising to me that writer-director Cord Jefferson is a disciple of one of the great works of television: season two of <cite>Master of None</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Just like the titles above, <cite>American Fiction</cite> grabs our attention without a flicker of a grandiose plot. Events happen naturally, making the movie feel remarkably simple and, at times, devastating. The inciting incident is when Monk, comprehensively portrayed by Jeffrey Wright, greets a huge audience for author Sintara Golden’s new book, “We’s Lives in Da Ghetto,” a fictional book written in Black English. Monk sees legions of white folks applauding and embracing Sintara’s tale, which he finds incredibly hollow, stroking a simplistic and narrow vision of Black people in the audience’s mind. Her book seems to fly off the shelves. His books are the opposite: nuanced tales of Black folks that don’t sell well.</p>

                    <p>Understandably, Monk is disappointed and irritated at what sells. In the beginning of the film, he is forced to take a leave of absence for directly using the N-word in classroom discussion, offending a white student. Beyond a direct implication of America’s current political moment, the moment did not feel significant. On further inspection, the moment explains the conceit of the film. It is the most frustrating type of hypocrisy that a Black professor gets sent home for openly raising a derogatory slur that should make <em>him</em> the most uncomfortable, not the girl in the first row. How do you move past basic stereotypes when no one wants to hear the truth? </p>

                    <p>In what starts as a good joke, Monk envisions another book in the zone of “We’s Lives in Da Ghetto,” but using the most extreme stereotypes in his storytelling. Missing fathers, hiding from the cops, a Darth Vader-esque reveal when the son realizes his father stands before him, and an inevitable gunning down of the aforementioned father by his son. Monk grew up in a middle-class family, earned a PhD in English, and has two siblings with medical degrees; he probably knows as much about living in a ghetto as a person from Nantucket.</p>

                    <p>To give his book credibility, he uses a pseudonym, Stagg R. Leigh, and pretends he is a wanted convict with a gruff voice. The publisher goes bonkers, offering hundreds of thousands for the rights. A Hollywood producer pays millions for the movie rights. Cord Jefferson is pulling at a contradiction in American dialogue: Monk’s open discussion of America’s past in a classroom is offensive, but his cliché-ridden book titled “FUCK” about Black people in the ghetto is not?</p>

                    <p>During his leave of absence, Monk decides to reconnect with his family: his sister, brother, mother, and his parent’s caretaker. I loved this family. Often, the dialogue between brothers and sisters is mishandled, tipped unevenly towards heavy exposition with no conflict. Cord Jefferson avoids all the booby traps: I was pulled in from the first moments with smart dialogue and great casting. For example, Maynard (Raymond Anthony Thomas) is a perfectly cast character, with less than five minutes of screentime, whose jolly nature leaves an indelible mark. The whole family offers such a contrast to the popular works in the film that peddle an entirely different image of Black people in America. Monk would appreciate the nuance of the film.</p>

                    <p>At the core of <cite>American Fiction</cite>’s structure lies the funniest part. The Black family at the heart of Cord Jefferson’s script could encompass any ethnicity in America. Make it a story about an Indian, Latino, Chinese, or Native family. It could just as heartfelt and equally caustic. Ethnic stereotypes abound – and they can be exploited for big monetary gain. The universal question that Monk confronts is whether falsely validating anyone’s wide generalizations about a specific group is a sin. </p>

                    <p>Is profiting off someone’s gullibility unworthy of an artist? Pushing the concept even further: in a story centered around characters of your ethnicity, what if someone you deeply admire sees serious value where you see ridiculousness? Taken to the absolute extreme: what if that someone – a friend, family member, or lover – shares your ethnicity? <cite>American Fiction</cite> goes to that place, though, depending on how you feel, it might not stick the landing because the ending is left open.</p>

                    <p>If Jefferson had offered a closed ending, where we see Monk publicly address his pseudonymous book or attempt to restart his relationship with Coraline, it would force an authoritative stance on the character to be shared. Cord Jefferson is a wise filmmaker, so he provokes thoughts, instead of answering our doubts.</p>

                    <p>The merits of what Jefferson attempted to do are clear. Before Monk’s extended debate with Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), we know where Monk stands on his book. After that conversation, does he change his stance – and more importantly, should he? It is our choice and a fantastic conversation to be had after the movie. I appreciate the openness, but there will certainly be some who do not. That might be exactly the point that Jefferson is trying to make.</p>
