    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>The opening scene of <cite>Spotlight</cite> is a three-minute case study of a societal ill. After the Universal Studios fanfare, the legendary composer Howard Shore introduces the main tune in his score: a moody and foreboding piano. In a Boston police station, a young cop questions an older one about unusual visitors. A priest sits alone in the break room. In an interrogation room, a Catholic Bishop consoles a mother while her four kids play around the table: <q>I give you my personal guarantee that … this will never happen again.</q> An Assistant District Attorney sits in on the encounter; his presence lends an informal seal of approval.</p>

                    <p>Later, the young cop stands outside on a cigarette break. The station door opens. The Bishop and the priest walk out and into a car. A driver takes them away. Like us, the young cop does not know what to say. <cite>Spotlight</cite>’s opening scene is perplexing, leaving us powerless like the young cop. Only in hindsight do we finally understand. This was no <q>bad apple.</q> It was a cancer that continued to spread. It was an epidemic that everyone saw but nobody confronted. Who could wrestle this devastation out of the shadows – without being shut down by the Church?</p>

                    <p>Tracking the full scope of a single news story from inception to publication, the film centers on a group of investigative reporters who worked at the Boston Globe from July 2001 to early 2002. Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), a new editor, arrives, ready to bolster the local paper’s appeal to its readers. The Spotlight team, a bunch of long-term investigative journalists, expects corporate restructuring. Instead, Baron gives them a strong purpose and demands intense focus.</p>

                    <p><cite>Spotlight</cite> is bleak. Traumatized victims confront the demons of their past. Their experiences taint their whole childhood – and grow to define their life. The adults we meet are the lucky ones. <cite>Spotlight</cite> forces us to confront a troubling question: How did the system break so completely, that it could enable such cruelty upon America’s children?</p>

                    <p>The Spotlight team, a group of four journalists, makes the search for answers bearable. Each team member is a fighter, unwilling to cede any ground in their pursuit of the truth. In an age where minute-to-minute reporting consumes the airwaves, this team is a tonic. Marriage, sleep, or self-care be damned. Their ultimate objective is an airtight, painstakingly researched story that informs their community. The team appeals to the highest standard of journalism.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"I am here because I care. We are not going away. We are going to tell this story and we’re going to tell it right.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Complementing the efforts of real-life journalists, the four actors portraying them offer stellar work. With <cite>Spotlight</cite>, Mark Ruffalo made his mark upon another investigative film after 2007’s <cite>Zodiac</cite>, 2010’s <cite>Shutter Island</cite>, and eventually 2019’s <cite>Dark Waters</cite>. Playing Mike Rezendes, his character is blunt, aloof, and the most emotional member. Rachel McAdams and Brian d’Arcy James offer understated performances, with their characters displaying how much of journalism is meticulous fact-finding. For every word of their first story, at least ten to twenty hours were spent validating the information. This group turns over every stone. For six months, they carried a crushing story without leaking any details.</p>

                    <p>The leader of the Spotlight team is Robbie Robertson, played by Michael Keaton. Everyone in Boston picks up Robbie’s call. He is a hard-working and jovial guy, a force for good at the Globe. On the job, Robbie is an attack dog, loyal to his trusted companions and fierce with anyone who stands in the way of truth. To cover this story, Robbie risks his personal connections with friends in high places. For the first time, he must go after them.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"We’ve got two stories here. We’ve got a story about degenerate clergy and we’ve got a story about a bunch of lawyers turning child abuse into a cottage industry. Now, which story do you want us to write? ‘Cause we’re writing one of them."</blockquote>

                    <p><cite>Spotlight</cite>’s insightful screenplay is brimming with relevant detail and utterly devoid of inessentials. The writers, Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, made it so an overwhelming amount of <cite>Spotlight</cite> serves dual purposes: progressing the story to its conclusion, while conveying a fuller sense of the crushing impacts of child abuse.</p>

                    <p>The script places us in the shoes of the Spotlight reporters in a relentless onward march to build the story. The Spotlight reporters are empathetic but, on a job like this, finding the truth becomes an impersonal muscle. Along the way, we grow accustomed to the team’s approach: delving through interviews, archival materials (also known as “clips”), and dusty, hardbound books to back up a story.</p>
    			     
                    <p>McCarthy, who is also the director of <cite>Spotlight</cite>, is prudent with the camera, opting for a barebones, laissez-faire approach. McCarthy wisely trusts the actors and the story to speak for themselves. All of <cite>Spotlight</cite> is inordinately restrained, a reduction of melodramatic moments to their essence. McCarthy does a tightrope walk, knowing any scene from beginning to end could tip the balance. However, <cite>Spotlight</cite> saves its impact for a few natural stopping points, where McCarthy activates the pent-up emotion. As climaxes, they are the film’s best moments.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Show me this was systemic, that it came from the top down."</blockquote>

                    <p>McCarthy is interested in more than lionizing the Boston Globe’s reporters who did the hard work. There is a higher goal within <cite>Spotlight</cite>. The film merges the facts of the news story, the people behind it, and the people affected by it. Just as the Boston Globe broke these horrific stories, <cite>Spotlight</cite> builds on that foundation, offering an essential investigation into what enabled pervasive child abuse.</p>

                    <p>In Boston, survivors were too afraid or felt too much guilt to speak up. By the strong hand of cultural expectation, onlookers, like the young cop, felt compelled to look the other way. Some tried to get the press’s attention, but to no avail.</p>

                    <p>Years before Spotlight’s investigation, the Globe published some stories. None stuck around for long. In a town of Catholics, why spend resources on a story that will only upset others or make enemies? <cite>Spotlight</cite>’s incisive teeth do not come from its portrayal of the Catholic Church. The blow comes from the fact that complicity for what happened to thousands of children extends beyond the Church’s walls.</p>

                     <blockquote class="section-quote">"Mark my words, Mr. Rezendes, if it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one."</blockquote>

                    <p>McCarthy asks some of the most challenging, open questions of our time. What happens when people lose faith in their institutions? What replaces the important void left in the people’s hearts? How culpable is our society for despicable events that transpire?</p>

                    <p>With nearly ten years of distance from the film and almost twenty-five years from the breaking news itself, <cite>Spotlight</cite> has not lost any relevance. It is a film of extraordinary depth, surrounded by stellar performances who are working off one of the best scripts ever written.</p>

                    <p>The Spotlight team was driven by the absolute thrill of a job well done. During all the emotional agony they endured for bringing such horrific stories into the light, they received little consolation. When the story was finally released, I was struck by the final words of Mitch Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) in the film. Garabedian is a busy lawyer who defends survivors of all ages: abused children and scarred adults. In a small note of gratitude, he says,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Keep doing your work, Mr. Rezendes."</blockquote>
