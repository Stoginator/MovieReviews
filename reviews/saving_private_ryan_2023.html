    				<p>In 2022’s <cite>The Fabelmans</cite>, the audience discovers that some of the first movies that Steven Spielberg directed were small combat pictures with the kids in his Boy Scout troupe. Explosions were simulated by stepping on planks layered with loose dirt. Spielberg moved his handheld camera around kids who glorified the act of killing and dying. At the end of his movie, there is a scene where all the kids pretend to be dead as one soldier, being the final survivor, walks among the vanished. In that moment, those kids realized what really happens on the field of battle – the idea that war represents a kind of carnage that no words can touch. It took decades from that moment in Spielberg’s life before he finally found the right vessel to embody the ideas he learned as a kid.</p>

                    <p>Twenty-five years later after the film’s release, it is clear that <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite> established its own iconography: the extreme close-ups of two characters’ eyes, Spielberg’s handheld shots up the barrel of rifles, Captain Miller’s (Tom Hanks) shaking hand, the silhouetted frames of the company in France, the terrifying screech of tanks during the last battle, and, my favorite, the $300 pool on who can out Captain Miller’s origin. <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite> is the most famous World War II movie in America.</p>

                    <p>When I watched it for the first time knowing almost nothing about it, I remember the anticipation of waiting for the opening logos to subside and then discovering something I did not expect. Watching it again today, I felt things that I never did the first time.</p>

                    <p>For starters, the <a href="https://youtu.be/xYYzda54UaU?feature=shared&t=169">scene-stealer</a> of the film is Ryan Hurst, the actor who portrays Mr. Gerry Bertier in 2000’s <cite>Remember the Titans</cite>. His character, Paratrooper Michaelson, has lost his ear to a German grenade, but he still brings a smile to our faces when we least suspect it – yelling at Captain Miller and delivering some good news.</p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">From left: Paratrooper Michaelson, a fellow soldier (Nick Brooks), and Captain Miller in conversation as Michaelson yells, <q>No! James FRANCIS Ryan!</q></figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>I was struck by the irony of the three survivors of Captain Miller’s Second Ranger Battalion and their individual arcs of discovery. The man most protesting the mission, Private Reiben (Edward Burns), hates the idea of Ryan – a guy who gets to go home just because he suffered a little bit more than everyone else. When Reiben fights alongside Ryan in the last battle, there is a particular framing of the two. Nothing is exchanged except for some steady glances. We see Reiben learn he wouldn’t want to walk in Ryan’s shoes. He also discovers how hard it is to hate up close.</p>

                    <p>The second survivor, Upham (Jeremy Davies), had a sensibility that frustrated me to no end. His character illustrated the constant tension between what feels right in the moment and the rules of engagement. I wondered why is he protecting the life of a Nazi who just killed one of our own? In the last battle, I grew hot and impatient: how could this man not overcome his fear to rescue his brother in a time of need? Eventually, Upham avenges his company, killing the Nazi he persuaded Captain Miller to let go.</p>

                    <p>Upham poses questions of conviction to us. Would we heed the call of duty? Would we maintain our morality by following the rules of war? Having never experienced great horrors, who am I to judge him? Upham is just an American kid who ends up surrounded by the deadliest of events. In these circumstances, knowing what to do is a puzzle.</p>

                    <p>Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is marked by the sacrifice of the company, the many men who admirably performed their duties by following orders they didn’t like to spare his life. In this way, <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite> is about the uniqueness of the American tradition. Facing an existential threat, what other army would order, let alone consider, sending an entire company to save one man’s life, risking many to save one?</p>

                    <p>When we finally learn the true identity of the man visiting the Normandy American Cemetery, we also see that Ryan’s stories of that day were never shared. Even after many years, Mrs. Ryan discovers that Captain Miller’s gravestone is a central part of her husband’s story. That small detail made all the difference. My goodness did the emotions fly in, but the tears flowed much later.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Who is Captain John H. Miller? I was shocked upon learning one of the film’s great secrets, a source of great interest to the company as well. Captain Miller says, <q>I’m a schoolteacher. I teach English composition in this little town called Adley, Pennsylvania.</q> Miller says this to break the high tension, a moment of the possible implosion of the company. Choosing that time to end the $300 pool is indicative of Miller’s steady and unshowy leadership. The ordinary origin of his character represents a truism about the world we live in. He is a reminder that heroes come from anywhere and are all around us in plain sight.</p>

                    <p>The Greatest Generation who participated in World War II are the men and women who upended their lives and postponed their plans to fight for something intangible: ideals. They were regular folks who fought for freedom and democracy. When it is put like that, it sounds inaccessible. Walking around France, did Captain Miller really think about saving democracy? I don’t think so. For him, it was about making sure that his hammock in the backyard was still there when he got back.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, it was the character of Captain John Miller that led me to realize <em>the</em> core tenet of Steven Spielberg’s movies: they are all courageous stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. This theme began in fictitious waters: an archaeologist, a boy and an alien, and a paleontologist. Those were powerful tales, but by delving into the stories of America, Spielberg has tapped into something more. Still, the men we follow in the film’s Second Ranger Battalion may be fictitious, but the Second Ranger Battalion itself was a very real part of D-Day. Spielberg is building many of his narratives around American heroes and documenting our history in ways that can’t be gleaned from a textbook.</p>

                    <p>For younger Americans, it may be difficult to make a connection from the soldiers who landed on the beaches on D-Day to our modern-day life. When Captain Miller whispers his last words to Private Ryan, he famously says, <q>James, earn this… Earn it.</q> Miller is not just speaking to the Private. Like Ryan was marked by those who gave their lives to save him, we inherited the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands who died <q>upon the altar of freedom</q> as Lincoln said. Building that sense of continuity from the actions in World War II to today is the most epic achievement of <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite>.</p>

                    <p>In that way, the film lays that great spirit of moral conviction at our doorstep: how can we honor their service and their sacrifice? It is a social debt that can never be paid back, but we must do our best.</p>
