    				<p>What happens when what we think is true is actually a fiction? What happens when a technology on the scale of entire governments – a digital agent with its own interests - tries to achieve global domination?</p>

                    <p>A manipulative artificial intelligence is the new enemy: unleashed onto the internet, attacking at will, forging communications, and seeking to control its destiny. In a fresh take on modern anxieties, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) faces his equal - or something better - in <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Governments are racing against each other to become the master of this artificial general intelligence (AGI) agent, known as <i>The Entity</i>. It is a digital agent so powerful that it can bend cyber-reality through impersonated communications, hired hands, and encryption breaking. Text messages and emails from friends may not be from them. Digital copies can be changed without a trace. It is watching everyone and predicting all outcomes faster than you can consider one. Reality itself bends to The Entity’s will. The question of who can control it drives the film and the geopolitical implications are fun, pitting allies against each other and forcing enemies to collude. An AGI is an amazing driver of story, especially for our time, creating plausible and surprising scenarios to test the <i>Mission</i> team.</p>

                    <p>After taking a week to digest <cite>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One</cite>, one thing is clear: the title is way too long. As of July 25, 2023, the film has only made $120 million in the United States - noticeably behind <cite>Fallout</cite>’s numbers at the same point. Two other, hidden part ones (<cite>Fast X</cite> and <cite>Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</cite>) may have reduced audiences’ appetite to see incomplete stories at the cinema. Fans already saw Harrison Ford in an unworthy entry to the already complete <cite>Indiana Jones</cite> franchise - and did not want to risk seeing another example with Tom Cruise. More significantly, Barbenheimer is ruling the world; releasing a week before the phenomenon was unlucky and not wise. I was lucky to catch this film in IMAX in the week it had before <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> replaced it. For a general audience, the most unforgivable aspect is the <cite>Part One</cite>; although, it cannot be omitted in the title without massively disappointing fans.</p>

                    <p>Due to that moniker, <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> makes less interesting (or incomplete) character choices. As explored previously, Ethan is conflicted between protecting his team and accomplishing his mission. Benji, Luther, and Ilsa do what they normally do. The newcomer Grace (played by Hayley Atwell) is the only bright spot.</p>

                    <p>The execution is not the issue; <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> is an easily watchable film, Tom-Cruise-sprinting through 160 minutes and presenting a tension-filled ride. What lessens the experience is my reflection on the bones of the story afterwards. I was left with many  questions whose answers I probably missed. Some beats felt unnatural to the story, too extraordinary to occur, or even confusing. I need a rewatch to hear the origins of The Entity again. There are so many new characters that need time to breathe that original team members are not given a satisfying presence (or even an arc at all).</p>

                    <p>The event which gives this mission its name, Ilsa’s death, felt undeserved and serving off-screen requirements rather than the story. At this point, it is futile to argue against a canon event, but I would have liked to be a fly on the wall when this story event was decided. Ilsa’s death was preordained as the major event of this two-parter. McQuarrie tries to make sure her death is not objectionable - foreshadowing the event and giving Ilsa’s passing its strong emotional due with the most memorable musical cues and sights of Ethan running. My favorite visual in the film was Ethan, covered in shadow, running through steam down a claustrophobic alley in Venice.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Ilsa (and the actress Rebecca Ferguson) will be missed.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, the motorcycle cliff stunt was introduced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1drlOZSDw&pp=ygUcbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDcgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D">first (epic) trailer</a> for the film screened before <cite>Top Gun: Maverick</cite>. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw&pp=ygUfbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDcgZmVhdHVyZXR0ZQ%3D%3D">nine minute IMAX featurette</a> was shown before <cite>Avatar: The Way of Water</cite>. Having consumed all that media as a fan, the final product in the film was underwhelming. The full moment in context was great, but totally predictable and unsatisfactory. I expected more from it in the final film having experienced the thrill a few times before. It also leads up to a deus ex machina that felt like a cheat (when Ethan saves Grace from imminent danger) because it was inconsistent with previous events in the film. How can death arrive so emotionally and then be so easily evaded moments later?</p>

                    <p>On a better note, Lorne Balfe’s score reaches for new heights, retaining <cite>Fallout</cite>’s bongos and big horns while adding a depth of feeling through the use of trumpets and string instruments. These components merge beautifully in “Get Out Now” and “Chasing Grace.” While <cite>Fallout</cite> introduced more compelling musical themes that ring in the mind long after the film ends, <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> banks on emotion and adrenaline in the moment; it serves that purpose well.</p>

                    <p><cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> is not a match for the full package of <cite>Fallout</cite>, but the experience of watching it is better in some respects. The narrative seamlessly jumps from conversation to action and from one city to another. It is a style of action filmmaking that only Cruise and McQuarrie can manage. Their pursuit of perfection rages on, but the breadth of the story minimizes this film’s impact. <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> has its share of great set pieces, an intriguing and timely premise, and welcome comedy, but there are so many characters that the central cast sees a digression - a descent back to well-trodden territory. A repackaging of old parts, one might say. The pieces of a great <cite>Mission</cite> film are all here, but it lacks internal consistency.</p>

                    <p>There is an exhaustion creeping into <cite>Mission</cite> in terms of the emotional journey of Ethan Hunt. After seven films, the creative team tries to push Ethan Hunt into emotional places he has never before ventured. Taking away Ilsa was one way, but her death leaves a bad taste. She gives the ultimate sacrifice to protect someone she does not know - just like anyone on the team would. Yet, I wonder: was she built up just to be taken away? Maybe. Unfortunately, as one half of the story, the full impact of his final journey is yet to come.</p>

                    <p><cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite> is an uneven time at the movies. After the credits rolled, I said, “This was better than <cite>Fallout</cite>!” As soon as the words were uttered, something felt wrong. When the adrenaline subsided, the experience felt hollow: a rollercoaster experience that looks brand new but feels off. <cite>Dead Reckoning Part Two</cite> might retroactively patch some holes, but as a standalone title, the first part crumbles upon closer examination.</p>
