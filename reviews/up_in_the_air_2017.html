    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Up in The Air</cite> is a film about how we confront change. How change creeps up on us when we least expect it. How change sometimes presents itself as something comfortable like something we know - when it isn’t. Change can be wonderful and heartbreaking all in one gust of wind - such as getting laid off only to discover it was worth the pain. <cite>Up in The Air</cite> follows a character who seems like the most resistant to change, but like time, change gradually erodes our ways. </p>

                    <p>Up in the Air is about Ryan Bingham (played by the great George Clooney), a traveling downsizer - someone a company hires to tell their own employees that they are fired - who, as we learn, feels no commitments to anyone but himself. "Family?", you might ask - well, not really. Ryan is perfectly content with his job - he's the best at it - and his goal in life is to achieve a secret, but excessively high number of frequent-flyer miles with American Airlines. He prides himself on the fact that he carries no baggage in his life, other than the swift briefcase he totes around on his flights.</p>

                    <p>On one of his hotel stops, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) - someone just like him - that is, a nonstop traveller. Ryan sees in her someone just like him and they get along very well. But, they're nothing more than acquaintances to each other - they don’t want to carry extra baggage. It's a lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>Good setup? Let's introduce what turns Ryan's life upside-down. Enter Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young Cornell graduate who wants to replace the traveling Ryan does everyday by using video conferencing. Ryan's understandably unhappy and his boss's idea is to take Natalie with him to see why his job is undoable from a computer screen.</p>

                    <p>When Natalie is first introduced, I didn't take to her. She upset Ryan's lifestyle and my relationship with her was no better than Ryan's relationship with the people he fires everyday. Yet, as life goes, people grow on you because they're people with personalities and stories. Natalie is having relationship problems and relies on Ryan and Alex for support. She constantly bombards Ryan on why he doesn't want more from life - a family and a lover. She tries to understand why he doesn’t desire meaningful relationships. </p>

                    <p>Ryan's not ready to commit - to anything. Not a home or a wife. “Kids?” Forget about it. Director Jason Reitman's allows us to empathize with Ryan's dilemmas (which no doubt is only aided by Clooney's performance). But, the bigger picture is that, it's easy in life to criss-cross yourself when it comes to your apparent goals and aspirations. For example, when you were a child, you may have aspired to be an astronaut, yet, as an adult, you probably aren't one. We can travel far down a path before we realize it’s the wrong one. Bingham asks an employee he is laying off, “How much did they first pay you to give up on your dream?“ Reitman succeeds in taking that dilemma and placing it into our world.</p>

                    <p>The genius of the title, <cite>Up in the Air</cite>, comes from its apparent meaning of tying in to Ryan's lifestyle, but also its deeper significance of roads uncrossed or unresolved for Ryan. At the end of the film, Ryan stops in front of the arrivals and departures board at OMA for the first time. Looking at the board, you can see he's in shock because of what it means to him. Something he once thought was the foundation of his life became undependable. That's life, I suppose.</p>
