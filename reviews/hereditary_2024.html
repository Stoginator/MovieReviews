    				<p>Halfway through writer-director Ari Aster’s film, I awoke from the trance that I surrendered to and asked an important question: why did he bring such an unsettling and painful movie into the world? I could not crack the answer, so I placed it aside in my mind.</p>

                    <p>Then, I saw one blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shot - and I understood.</p>

                    <p><cite>Hereditary</cite> captures the most overwhelming human emotion: grief. Its presence in the mind can cause our bodies to crumble and tear apart our reality. What was significant before becomes meaningless. In the face of grief, an action that was once irrational to you can become the most important thing you can ever do.</p>

                    <p>The film follows a suburban family, a group that is uninteresting to the eye but carry pent-up layers of emotions. The mother of this family, Annie (Toni Collette), is grieving her own mother’s passing, trying to reconcile with the complicated relationship she had with her. The father, Steve (Gabriel Bryne), is a soother, the one to lower the temperature when tensions get high. Unlike the others, he lets his common sense, not emotion, dominate his thinking.</p>

                    <p>Then, there are the two kids: Charlie (Molly Shaprio) and her older brother, Peter (Alex Wolff). Charlie is quiet, shy, and always lost in thought. Peter is a pot-smoker, resentful of his parents’ tight control on his life, and unable to forge a conversation with a girl he likes. If it sounds like a domestic drama, it mostly is. There is, however, a supernatural twist: Charlie sees visions of her dead grandmother in the distance. She feels lured towards her but is stopped in her tracks by her mother.</p>

                    <p>One night, when Peter is forced to bring Charlie to a high school party, every worst case scenario happens – in terrifying fashion. None of it is supernatural, but the entire sequence is disturbing in a skin-crawling sort of way. In my packed auditorium, I felt like everyone was holding their breath as they thought about this family’s disastrous predicament.</p>

                    <p>Charlie eats a piece of chocolate cake tainted by peanuts. Unable to breathe, Peter rushes her into the car to race to the hospital. But the unthinkable happens. Peter is so shaken by the events that he cannot process the new reality. He leaves the scene of the unfortunate incident without contacting anyone, arrives at home in the middle of the night, and forgets his sister’s headless body in the car.</p>

                    <p>In an instant, Annie’s entire worldview as a mother – the facts upon which she has built her identity – shatters. Her daughter is gone, her son is to blame, and she cannot breathe.</p>

                    <p>In the succeeding days, Peter cannot look at his parents. He arrives after dark to avoid their gaze – and the soul-crushing shame that he feels for inadvertently taking his sister’s life. Annie cannot comprehend her own emotions by herself. These characters are confronting the most powerful forces in our lives: grief and guilt. There is a reason that we refer to the mistakes of our past as our demons.</p>

                    <p>In these moments, the film itself feels like a trance with Spielberg-ian camera pans that slowly track characters or objects moving in a scene. The shot cuts are so well-defined that their presence is unnoticed. The sound design bounces between extremes: the quiet, environmental noise after an engine shuts off or the creaking of a door opening versus the piercing wails of Annie and deeply uncomfortable music. (Listen to the mind-numbing noise of <cite>Aftermath</cite> from Colin Stetson’s original score.) The mood makes us feel that immense sense of loss, the closing of the senses to any external input, and the pain that arrives.</p>

                    <p>Now, the journey for Annie is to excavate through the rubble of her mind and rebuild. But how? How can one come back from such a devastating blow?</p>

                    <p>That is what makes <cite>Hereditary</cite> such an interesting film. Clearly, it is a family drama disguised as a horror film. Given the brutality of these experiences and how they are captured, Ari Aster either turned his personal experience into a screen story, imagined such grievous trauma in the machinations of his mind, or combined both truth and fiction. <cite>Hereditary</cite> is very often a hard watch, but it always feels honest. That is the mark of art.</p>

                    <p>Annie’s search for emotional relief leads her to Joanie (Ann Dowd), a non-threatening older woman who lost her son and grandson in a drowning accident. Everyone in <cite>Hereditary</cite> is scarred by their experiences, trying to live with their trauma. One day, Joanie introduces Annie to a séance, a ritual for speaking to the dead. Annie is terrified by what she sees, but as she habituates to its novelty, she wants to recreate it herself. She is lured by its promise: she could still be Charlie’s mother.</p>

                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">The horror trope of a house in the forest never feels cliché because of its unsettling atmosphere.</figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The image that tied it all together for me was the opener of the film’s climactic sequence. In the shadows of this forest, you can see glimpses of people standing still in the night. These men and women are acolytes of their God – what we might call a devil. However, these naked bodies approaching the family’s house do not think of themselves as manifestations of evil. Among the wicked souls stands Joanie.</p>

                    <p>Annie’s séances invite evil spirits. As she uncovers her mother’s hidden history, she becomes possessed by one. These acolytes invade her home and seek to corrupt the last remaining member of the family, Peter. My interpretation of their gathering is, like Annie and Joanie, they are all grief-stricken beings. They are so warped by pain that they have morphed beyond rationality. To stop the suffering and bring back their loved ones, they have converted to a new religion and worship King Paimon, whose supernatural powers can murder to achieve its goals. The guilty survivors see their cause as just.</p>

                    <p><cite>Hereditary</cite> is about the madness of grief and the impossible lengths it can force you to go. To epitomize that, the ending is perverse, spiritual ecstasy put on film. A crown is put upon Peter’s head. Joanie reads to Peter, who represents the King Paimon in human form. In the minds of the congregation of survivors, a God has arrived to vanquish the pain, relieve their suffering, and lead them back to the departed. It is the greatest thing that has happened to them since their loved ones departed the earth. Colin Stetson’s track, <cite>Reborn</cite>, completely takes over the sound stage. In the IMAX theater where I rewatched this movie, it was the loudest moment of the film. It feels like their absolute conviction and faith has been rewarded.</p>

                    <p>Just like Annie, the people in this ceremony went through unimaginable loss. Wracked by grief, they turned to something they did not completely understand. They murder, trepass, and show no restraint in achieving their single-minded objective. They look like they are under a spell, but Joanie, the sole speaker of the cause, is incredibly lucid. Their presence in the darkness and even off-camera in the light was just enough to unnerve me.</p>

                    <p>Anyone who knows me knows that I don’t get scared watching horror movies. What terrifies me is when the world of a film reaches beyond its confines, showing us how scary the real world can be. Grief can make us do horrible things.</p>

                    <p>Luckily though, Ari Aster knows how and when to diffuse the tension. Once the end credits start, Judy Collins’s rendition of <cite>Both Sides Now</cite> starts playing, with its cheerful melody. It feels like Aster’s way of saying, <q>It’s just a movie, folks. Have a good evening!</q> I can’t wait to forget about the cult in this movie. Luckily, because of that one well-placed song, I might be able to.</p>
