    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Eddington</cite> is a film that truly stumped me. Halfway through, I was confused where it was going. I was enthralled and stunned by the drama, but unsure of what it all meant. I was patient because I felt there was something more.</p>

                    <p>When I reached the conclusion, I was puzzled: A shot of the <i>solidgoldmagikarp</i> data center sitting in the desert, with the town of Eddington, New Mexico in the distance behind it. On one hand, I thought, “It’s just a data center. They’re a dime a dozen.” However, I was impressed: “Did I ever imagine a Hollywood movie ending on a view of a fictional data center?” Leaving the theater, I was unsatisfied with the ending, but committed to unraveling what this movie was truly about.</p>

                    <p>I kept looking for a genre to put guardrails on my viewing experience. Satirical western? Uncanny horror? Black comedy? A story of disillusionment? <cite>Eddington</cite> mashes all of these together into a unique viewing experience. Yet, even after everything that happens, I couldn’t answer the most basic question: What was it about?</p>

                    <p>Then suddenly, it hit me. In the ending of <cite>Eddington</cite>, I found an access point into the film’s purpose, which helped me answer my most searing questions. Armed with the knowledge of all the events preceding it, the context of the final frame offers a dire warning for society.</p>

                    <p>In terms of genre, <cite>Eddington</cite> is more like a historical drama, looking into our very recent history for clues about where we are headed. No matter how crazy this movie got, everything felt incredibly plausible — as if it could be seen on a typical TikTok newsreel. Writer-director Ari Aster has made an American satire, keeping the mix of comedy and drama front-and-center, while hiding an intellectual slow-burn in plain sight. This story has an incredibly powerful thesis about information.</p>

                    <p><cite>Eddington</cite> begins in a conventional way. During the summer of 2020, the people of the fictional town of Eddington have disagreements on COVID-19 masking policy. We see this political conflict through the eyes of Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), who has difficulty breathing under a mask due to his asthma. Coincidentally, he also dislikes the idea of a government mandate. <cite>Eddington</cite> allows us to see the nuance; though, during a full-blown pandemic, any such grace is lost in translation.</p>

                    <p>Because of a statewide mask mandate in New Mexico, almost no one wants to listen to Joe’s appeals. He finds little patience and little kindness for this matter is life or death. In these reactions to Joe, Aster shows us how the norms of the internet has become the norms of face-to-face interaction. The vitriol projected by anonymous “internet users” seeped into real-life discourse in the form of finger pointing, taunting, and yelling. Unfortunately, Joe was on the opposite end of a big stick. His political stance on masking is enough information for others to impugn his character.</p>

                    <p>Facing rampant condescension from fellow police officers to left-of-center town citizens, Joe starts to feel threatened and insecure, which only emboldens his dissent. Even the mayor, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), and Joe can only speak past each other. <em>This should not be normal!</em> In a small town, the mayor and the sheriff need to work together.</p>

                    <p>Joe desperately wants to feel respected again. What does being a sheriff mean anymore?</p>

                    <p>To solve his personal crisis of meaning, Joe decides to run for mayor and unseat Ted Garcia. When Ted confronts him about the sudden announcement, Joe meets him on the street. In his frustration, Joe reflects back the venom that society sent his way for the first time. He attacks Ted’s character in a way that sounds like it comes from Reddit, saying,</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">JOE</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I am a much better human being than you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Humiliating people will make them say and do crazy things. Once the ball starts rolling down the hill in <cite>Eddington</cite>, it does not stop until lasting damage is done.</p>

                    <p><cite>Eddington</cite> is about the societal consequences of an incapacity to understand one another. When people en masse stop trying to find the wisdom in their opponent’s argument, a crisis will expose the fault lines in society. If the normal methods for resolving tension in a society are unworkable, then what happens?</p>

                    <p>In Ari Aster’s view, COVID-19 was our first modern experience reckoning with this question. This is why <cite>Eddington</cite> is about a fictional town exposed to real events. When his fictional characters react to actual incidents, Aster is trying to connect his dramatic story to real-world ideas. As the film plays out, it is clear to me that Aster is uninterested in short-term, political statements. In other words, the thesis of <cite>Eddington</cite> has nothing to do with left or right-leaning ideologies.</p>

                    <p>Rather, Ari Aster is making a lasting document of the times that speaks to <em>why</em> we are in this predicament. <cite>Eddington</cite> is a portrait of modern American society in the 2020s: screen-addicted, impatient, and divided. While Aster is interested in the effects of our brokenness, <cite>Eddington</cite> offers a story about the <em>causes</em>.</p>

                    <p>For a moment, consider the identity of the antagonist in <cite>Eddington</cite>. Do you feel strongly about any of the following choices?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sheriff Joe, our conservative protagonist</li>
                        <li>Ted Garcia, the liberal incumbent mayor</li>
                        <li>Louise (Emma Stone), Joe’s wife</li>
                        <li>Vernon (Austin Butler), the “embodiment of the internet” in Ari Aster's own words</li>
                        <li>The masked vigilantes who spread mayhem and sow discord in our towns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>None of these answers feel right. So who <em>or what</em> is it?</p>

                    <p>With perplexing movies, I tend to revisit the film in my mind. I use the visuals of a film to tick through the plot. One seemingly inconsequential scene stuck out to me.</p>

                    <p>This is a top-down, two-shot of the central married couple of the film: Louise and Joe. As they prepare to sleep, Joe turns to his side and grabs his iPhone off the nightstand. He starts mindlessly scrolling. Louise leans over to say something, so Joe turns his phone screen-down. After she finishes her thought, Louise moves to her side of the bed. Then, Joe returns to his phone.</p>
                </section>
                <figure class="inline-photo">
                    <img src="../assets/review_photos/eddington_phone.webp">
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>That is when I realized this isn’t a two-shot. Actually, this is a <em>three</em>-shot. The iPhone is the third character. Joe’s focus on his phone is so insignificant in the moment, yet so powerful in the aggregate.</p>

                    <p>In the film, the iPhone is the conduit through which the characters interact with the main forces driving the internet: data centers, algorithms, and social media apps. This system is at the center of these characters’ lives, maliciously influencing every knowing glance, line of dialogue, and action. These forces become the main driver of the plot. Yet, none of the characters realize how much they are influenced by their “feed.”</p>

                    <p>Neither did I. During the film, I was blind to this phenomenon. Characters scroll on their phone, consume fictitious articles, watch traumatic material, send and receive incendiary messages, and enter political silos of thought. I am so conditioned to these experiences in ordinary life that I never gave these plot-turning moments another thought. That seems to be exactly the response that Aster was looking for: The audience is as un-self-aware as the characters.</p>

                    <p>With the final frame of the <i>solidgoldmagikarp</i> data center, Aster turns <cite>Eddington</cite> into a two-and-a-half-hour experience of dramatic irony, where we are clued into something that none of the characters noticed.  The dramatic irony works on another level: It offers us an opportunity for self-reflection, to re-enter the madness of 2020 and understand <em>where</em> the craziness came from. (<i>What an optimistic note! I’ll bite.</i>)</p>

                    <p>So where does this mysterious, thought-altering, behavior-changing feed come from? A place that no one suspects: a data center. Data centers are massive collections of computing power, running algorithms that generate the images, videos, or tweets that arrive on your social media feed instantaneously. The algorithm learns from your behavior: It collects data on the content you liked on your feed or what content you spent the most time on. The more you use the apps, the smarter these algorithms get. The more they know you. <b>Let’s call this system the “Algorithmic Stranglehold.”</b></p>

                    <p>In just twenty years, data centers, algorithms, and social media apps have become so prevalent that we are indifferent to them. To maximize your time using the apps and make more money, technology companies will optimize to show you the best performing content, which tends to be extreme in nature. What happens when large portions of society spend hours per day monitoring their feeds?</p>

                    <p>The fictional tech company, <i>solidgoldmagikarp</i>, wants to open a data center near Eddington. The townspeople are legitimately concerned about energy and water consumption. Large data centers need a tremendous energy supply, enough to power an entire town or city in some cases. All those computers in one place run hot, so water is needed for cooling. But these are distractions.</p>

                    <p>It is a vicious flywheel: more data centers fuel smarter algorithms, those smarter algorithms spin up more addictive feeds, and the result is a society left worse off. Just as no one understands where the term <i>solidgoldmagikarp</i> comes from, no character in <cite>Eddington</cite> is self-aware enough to see the connection between more processing power and their actions.</p>
                    
                    <p>With <cite>Eddington</cite>, Ari Aster has dramatized an ongoing cycle of cause and effect that begins with data centers, phones, and social media and ends with disillusionment, violence, and loss of life. The film is an exploration of this cycle, specifically how quickly political disagreement sparks violence in the age of social media. Writer-director Ari Aster is making the case that <em>how</em> data centers are being used today leads directly to society’s downfall.</p>

                    <p>I am not surprised by the first reactions to the film, which focus on the film’s “polarizing” nature or its mischaracterizations of certain political views. Make no mistake: <cite>Eddington</cite> is politically neutral, but, today, any depiction of political subject matter sparks discontent about fair representation. This kind of discussion is part of the problem. It misses the mark.</p>

                    <p><cite>Eddington</cite> is a time capsule of the coded language, obsessions, and absurdities of the extreme left and right that flow from the internet. Phrases like “stolen land,” “anti-racist,” and “white critical” pervade the left. Cult-like communities, conspiratorial thinking about government cover-ups, and a fixation on revealing hidden and widespread child abuse dominate the right. How can you tell the difference between someone repeating a slogan and someone who really believes something? In <cite>Eddington</cite>, I was duped by one character in particular!</p>

                    <p>I suspect Aster has used the algorithms to his advantage, delving into the black hole of the Internet and spending hours on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram observing each political bubble. His contributions to the “chronically offline normies” are appreciated.</p>

                    <p><q>Sunlight is the best disinfectant</q> used to be a common refrain about how more information will bring the truth to light. Social media is a firehose of information, but does the world have more clarity about the truth? No, the truth is more opaque.</p>

                    <p>No plant can bloom under a 24/7 deluge of water. When it comes to information sorting, neither can we. It takes too much energy to be skeptical of everything you see. So, people are sorting out what is true and false for themselves. This creates a truth-less and trust-less world.</p>

                    <p><cite>Eddington</cite> has characters who literally believe in clashing realities — just as factions in American society do today. When a crisis begins, this broken ecosystem of information will rip our society apart. This brokenness created a dry haystack. COVID-19 was the match. It can happen again — and be even worse. We must ask: How do we break the cycle?</p>

                    <p>I left the theater in shock at the escalation of events, but something about it was very honest. Unfortunately, I can imagine a small town going this south this quickly. <cite>Eddington</cite> is Ari Aster’s attempt at holding up a mirror to America, with a silent plea: <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/KWVc74_AK68">We need to start listening to each other again</a>.</p>

                    <p><cite>Eddington</cite> is an artistic achievement, a film that is original,, dramatically entertaining, and thought-provoking. In a single experience, Aster aspires to capture American behavior and culture and point to its origin — our lack of self-awareness around how much our thoughts, words, and actions are influenced by powerful corporate and technological forces.</p>

                    <p>Experiencing such a big, artistic swing that offers honest observations about American society, I can’t ask much more of a filmmaker. Making a well-constructed and technically astounding film is difficult enough. Attempting to make sense of our world at the same time is downright insane. I salute Ari Aster’s work — in my eyes, he has succeeded.</p>

                    <p><i>P.S.</i> To read more about how our relationship to information and truth has changed since easy access to social media, I highly recommend Yuval Noah Harari’s book, <cite>Nexus</cite>. It disproved something I believed: In the age of social media, sunlight is not the best disinfectant. Now, I don't know what is.</p>
