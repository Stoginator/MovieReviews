    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>I wonder how writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson explained his newest movie, 2025’s <cite>One Battle After Another</cite>, before a single frame was shot.</p>

                    <p>If I had to pitch this film to studio executives, I’d say, <q>2001’s <cite>Finding Nemo</cite> meets 1998’s <cite>The Big Lebowski</cite>: A stoner-dad desperately searches for his missing daughter, forcing them to confront the ghosts of their past.</q></p>

                    <p><cite>One Battle After Another</cite> has comedy: Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Bob, runs around southern California in a bathrobe and slippers, struggling to remember code speak he used in a past life. It has action: Cars chases burst into the story in cities, mountains, and vast deserts. It has emotion and drama: Are the father and daughter going to reunite with each other?</p>

                    <p>This memorable line captures the tone:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">BOB</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I have abused drugs and alcohol for the past thirty years, man. I’m a drug and alcohol lover. And I cannot remember, for the life of me or the life of my only child, the answer to your question.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But richer themes are hidden in plain sight. <cite>One Battle After Another</cite> is a political reflection of America in the original Greek sense of the word: a story about the people of a nation.</p>

                    <p>During car chases, I asked myself, <q>When is it acceptable for a people to disobey the laws passed by their government?</q></p>

                    <p>As a teenager learns her family’s history, I wondered, <q>Should a child be held accountable for the sins of her parents?</q></p>

                    <p>Three characters symbolize powerful factions in American society — but Anderson never announces it. The audience is trusted to interpret how their actions in the story world reflect how their real-life counterparts influence the nation.</p>

                    <p>Putting such material in a story is dangerous; it is an easy red flag for an audience who is looking for escapism, not a return to the crises of the day. Yet, <cite>One Battle After Another</cite> comments on American society without breaking its own spell. How?</p>

                    <p>All the cinematic fundamentals come first and foremost. <cite>One Battle After Another</cite> engages the audience on a moment-to-moment basis. It has an unpredictable, crisscrossing plot, committed performances from a cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, and surprising bursts of levity. And, like the best novels, meaning emerges everywhere — in the visuals, in musical choices, and in character.</p>

                    <p>Two moments moved me greatly. One was the film’s climax, as a story about family is bound to do. The other caught me off guard — uncovering memories I had forgotten.</p>

                    <p>Willa (Chase Infiniti) is a young girl practicing her karate forms, rhythmically moving towards the camera. Seeing her breath work and controlled motion sent me back to my childhood karate school, where I practiced forms for four years.</p>

                    <p>This shot’s placement in the story greatly affected me. It reveals a core idea about America.</p>

                    <p><b>Moment #1:</b> In <cite>One Battle After Another</cite>’s opening shot, Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) is identified as the catalyst of the film’s plot.

                    <p><b>Moment #2:</b> After Colonel Lockjaw (Sean Penn) is nominated into the “Christmas Adventurers Club,” his eyes swell with tears at the possibility of joining an exclusive organization of white supremacists. He is personally vindicated like never before.</p>

                    <p>In these two moments, Paul Thomas Anderson signals that these two activists have found their calling — impacting the world in a way they feel they were born to do. Their worldviews are incompatible, yet Anderson’s story is built from their paths intersecting.</p>

                    <p>A black revolutionary and a white supremacist walk into a bar. One loaded gun lays on the countertop. What happens next? In <cite>One Battle After Another</cite>, they surrender to each other.</p>

                    <p>As a member of the French 75, a group of left-wing revolutionaries, Perfidia robs banks, frees unauthorized migrants from detention centers, and bombs buildings. She is their most aggressive member, intimidating fellow citizens over the phone. Her mother tells Bob:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MOTHER</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">My child comes from a whole line of revolutionaries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>It is never explained why these revolutionaries feel they must go outside the system to change laws. Their conviction is just that strong. Revolutionaries are driven by deep and mysterious purposes.</p>

                    <p>Enter Colonel Lockjaw. Unlike Perfidia, he quietly amasses power in an institution, the American military. By playing within the system, he can marshal resources to achieve his aims on a scale that the French 75 will never know.</p>

                    <p>In an immigration detention center, Perfidia discovers the commanding officer, Lockjaw, and points a gun at him. Perfidia realizes that Lockjaw has no fear of her; rather, she ignites his imagination. Perfidia cuffs him, while the French 75 free every unauthorized migrant. He tells Perfidia:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">LOCKJAW</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I’ll be seeing you very soon.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Lockjaw stays true to his word. He finds Perfidia before another bank bombing and holds her at gunpoint. Instead of arresting her, he makes her an offer: Meet me at a motel tonight or I’ll kill all your friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>That night, Perfidia goes to the motel. She is coerced into the venue, but the proceedings take an unexpected turn. In an intimate moment, Perfidia places Lockjaw‘s pistol on his own neck. Lockjaw relishes his powerlessness. Perfidia doesn’t resist the moment either — she leads it.</p>

                    <p>Initially, this relationship befuddled me. How does this happen? In each encounter, these two forces meet at gunpoint, symbolizing the extreme tension between them. They are not meant to cooperate.</p>

                    <p>But they do.</p>

                    <p>For Lockjaw, Perfidia was the first woman who saw <em>into</em> him, recognizing his true nature and violating it simultaneously. He became obsessed with that feeling and Perfidia. For Perfidia, emasculating Lockjaw was the ultimate expression of power. She wanted to dominate him. She couldn’t leave that motel.</p>

                    <p>Perfidia becomes pregnant and has a baby girl whose father is a mystery. It could be Lockjaw or her romantic partner, Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio). That dramatic question of identity elevates <cite>One Battle After Another</cite> from an action-adventure comedy into an American allegory. Under the spell of a first watch, I rooted for Bob. But Anderson knew where this story must go.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="section-quote smash-cut"><b><em>CUT TO:</em></b></blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Sixteen years later, Willa is a young teenager, living in the wilderness with Bob and no mother-figure. Perfidia died when she was a baby. Willa’s identify is propped up by a central myth: Bob is her father. Her mother was a hero, sticking it to the man until her end.</p>
                    
                    <p>Willa does not know the truth about her parents. Perfidia abandoned her as a baby, refusing the obligations of motherhood and embracing the French 75 anew. In her second act, she murdered a police officer. To stay free, she gave up the names of her fellow revolutionaries. She is not the hero that Willa believes.</p>

                    <p>And Bob is not her biological father. That title belongs to Colonel Sean Lockjaw, who believes her very existence is a stain on his legacy.</p>

                    <p>When a child’s foundational myths are destroyed, what happens to them? Can a child ever recover from such a destabilizing force? When these are our dramatic questions, Paul Thomas Anderson uses the main title track for the third and final time:</p>

                    <p><b>Moment #3:</b> Handcuffed, Willa stands in the entrance of an emptied church, with no pews. Like a king sitting upon a throne, Lockjaw sits at the other end, by the altar.</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">LOCKJAW</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Come closer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Willa begins her slow walk toward Lockjaw. With every step, she gets closer to learning the truth about where she came from. Like the main title music plays for her parents in their defining moments, this encounter has the potential to be Willa’s defining moment. She is about to learn that the man sitting before her, the white supremacist, is her father.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Her parents are responsible for her life as she knows it. She is traumatized by their actions: Her mother was a rat who got her friends killed and her father represents America’s most evil corner.</p>

                    <p>A DNA test confirms Lockjaw’s relation to Willa. Later, he says to her:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">LOCKJAW</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I am a Christmas adventurer. You know what that is? I have a higher calling. It is a higher honor than having you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In this scene, I understood that Willa is the film’s true protagonist. While Bob, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the headliner of <cite>One Battle After Another</cite>, my review has little to do with his character. Bob is reactive, always racing to the tune of others’ decisions. He provides crucial levity for the audience, but he does not set the film’s events in motion.</p>

                    <p>When Willa learns the truth about her family, she decides to reclaim her agency. For her entire life, external circumstances controlled her destiny. But now, she is going to fight. Lockjaw keeps the cuffs on her and plans to disappear her, erasing the evidence of his affair.</p>

                    <p>But Willa fights. She fights as hard as she can: Kicking, screaming, sprinting. She keeps her wits, finding herself in a crazy situation with militarized men, but she stays calm. When she gets an opening, she takes it.</p>
                    
                    <p>The world put her in an unimaginable circumstance. Your loving father is not your real father. Your mother is not a hero. Your real father is the worst kind of man. The world asked her: Will you be bound by the trauma of your past — or are you strong enough to create your own legacy?</p>

                    <p>Finally, Bob finds her! But Willa’s world has been turned upside down. She’s a kid in handcuffs pointing a sidearm. Bob comes into view, smiling at the sight of her.</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">BOB</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">It’s your dad, Willa! Look at me.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But his smile disappears. Willa’s still holding her gun up. She doesn’t trust her eyes.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="script-list">

                    <p>Willa forces Bob to repeat the codewords that only they know. When he does, she rushes into his arms.</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">BOB</li>

                    </ul>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote smash-cut"><b><em>CUT TO:</em></b></blockquote>

                    <p>Some time later, Bob and Willa are back at home, having gone through the emotional wreckage. Willa is smiling again. The radio goes off:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">RADIO</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">MKU raids in progress. Meeting point for protestors is Lincoln Park.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As Bob smokes a doobie on the couch, Willa decides to head out to a protest three hours away.</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">BOB</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Hey, be careful!</li>

                    <p>Paul Thomas Anderson ends the film on the song <cite>American Girl</cite> by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. It’s a great beat — with a larger significance.</p>

                    <p><cite>One Battle After Another</cite> is driven by this messed-up, twisted family. Within it, the mother and father are two fiercely opposing forces. Somehow, those forces produce a baby girl, who is separated from them. We wonder about the girl: Who will she become?</p>

                    <p>As she grows up, the child learns the truth about her biological parents. She is traumatized by how they chose to influence the world. She senses their abandonment, their hatred, and their inability to place others above themselves.</p>
                    
                    <p>This child did nothing to deserve them. They have created demons in her past. She is weighed down by them. There is little reason she should be kind or optimistic.</p>

                    <p>But she is. Rather than follow her parents, this child decides to forge her own path. She chooses to take all the negative energy poured into her and transform it into something better.</p>

                    <p>Can you see it now?</p>

                    <p>Willa’s journey is a metaphor for growing up as an American. Her parents represent our country’s multi-faceted history. Even if our families were not present for all that was, all Americans inherit the weight of the nation’s past. To quote Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: <em>She was an American Girl!</em></p>

                    <p>The ending of <cite>One Battle After Another</cite> brings a giant smile to my face; it is, perhaps, the most optimistic view of America in modern cinema.</p>

                    <p>For the first time in their father-daughter relationship, Bob rests easy as Willa exits the house. Bob, who epitomizes the current generation, knows his daughter has learned the lessons from his bad examples. Willa, who epitomizes the next generation, is excited to make her mark on the world — constructively.</p>

                    <p>So, back to the karate shot that made me cry.</p>

                    <p>As she practiced her forms, I saw myself in her shoes. I thought: What if the most important moments of my life were decided before I had a choice? What if I was defined by where I came from?</p>
                    
                    <p>Willa simply refuses — not in a big, grandiose way. By choosing to be better, Willa breaks the cycle. She puts one foot in front of the other, fighting one battle after another. She embodies the best qualities of the American spirit.</p>

                    <p>We are all Willa. The question is: Will we make the same choice?</p>
