                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>For the third film in the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series, J.K. Rowling and producers at Warner Bros. brought in Alfonso Cuarón, a filmmaker with extraordinary range to make children’s films like 1995’s <cite>A Little Princess</cite> and serious adult dramas like 2001’s <cite>Y tu mamá también?</cite> Turns out, they knew what they wanted – and they got it, a fresh entrance into an already developed world that equally appealed to both kids and adults.</p>

                    <p>Cuarón added something completely different to the series, with his own visual style filled with interesting and foreboding imagery: locking doors, pouring rain, winding clocks, and iris wipes. As Sirius Black, a mass murderer searching for Harry, looms closer to Hogwarts, these subliminal acts make us feel that threat is closing in around the protagonists.</p>

                    <p>For the most part, Cuarón leans into a desaturated look for the film. Take the Quidditch scene, a moment that was bursting with green, red, and yellow in the previous two films. This time around, a torrential downpour fades all the color out of the picture leaving behind a blue slate. Save for a beautiful tracking shot down the hills to Hagrid’s hut, the lush grass of Hogwarts barely rears its head in the picture.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Moreover, bold color is mostly presented at the extremes of black or white – and rarely otherwise. Beginning with Harry’s first encounter with Sirius the Dog in Little Whinging, Cuarón emphasizes nighttime as a moment of great peril. Hogwarts’s massive, barricaded gates, the enormous gears operating the school’s clockwork, and the Shrieking Shack push such ominous notions further. Winter in Hogsmeade is the only dominant setting of white color, featuring a very fun snow fight. That white color quickly fades out of the film’s setting as Harry’s intention grows dark: he resolves to murder Sirius Black.</p>

                    <p>Even the creature design points in the way of color at the extremes: Sirius the Dog has dark black fur, Buckbeak the Higgogriff rocks a coat of gray feathers, Lupin the Werewolf has gray skin and white hair, and the Dementors of Azkaban, cloaked in black, represent pure evil.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another wonderful part of the film are the long takes, colloquially called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q4X2vDRfRk&pp=ygUOc3BpZWxiZXJnIG9uZXI%3D">Spielberg Oners</a>, attributed to the man who re-popularized them. They are inconspicuous, hidden from the conscious act of watching a film. When we are engrossed by the story, they further entrench us by eliminating cuts and allowing our eye to wander through the frame. Cuarón fills the entire movie with them: a conversation between Harry and Mr. Weasley, the students' first encounter with a Boggart, Harry and Lupin talking on the bridge and in the forest, and, at the end of the film, Harry and Hermione running back to the hospital wing. Honestly, I did not notice one until Harry and Hermione are hiding from Lupin the Werewolf, where the camera, in a moment of dramatic irony, shows us the locations of all characters involved – making us squirm when Harry and Hermione are discovered.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wonder how many of these decisions were consciously made, rather than instinctively done. We may try to reverse engineer the reasons attached to the look of the film, but sometimes, like in <cite>Prisoner of Azkaban</cite>, the sequence of images we see just connect in a visceral way for reasons we cannot verbalize – and only feel. As the best children’s films do, this film provides wonderful exposure to the language of cinema.</p>

                    <p>In addition, writer Steve Kloves did great work on this film: simultaneously darkening the tone of the film, while injecting it with the most humor in the series so far. All of the scenes with Malfoy, the three wunderkinds, Dumbledore, and even Professor Snape are glorious fun. Having seen the film many times, I was surprised to discover new interpretations of the story climax. With his only remaining family on the line, Harry produces a powerful Patronus Charm that reverberates around the lake. The story flips on restoring justice to an innocent, honorable man – who we once thought was a murderer. Even without a connection to Voldemort, it has one of the strongest endings: <q>The ones who love us never really leave us, you can always find them… in here.</q></p>

                    <p>That being said, I wondered why the last shot of the film, a freeze-frame of Harry blasting through the air on his new <em>Firebolt</em> broomstick, ends on an iris wipe. A man, serving time for dubious charges, was freed, hope was restored, and justice was wrought. If the threat of a murderer closing in on Harry was gone, why would the last cut of the picture be an iris wipe? One could ascribe a couple reasons to it: consistency (that is how sequences end in Prisoner of Azkaban) or the fact that danger yet remains for Harry.</p>

                    <p>I hear a valid case for each of them, but I like this best: well, that one was just for fun. Given all the dreariness in this film, especially Ron’s line that <q>I felt like I would never be cheerful again,</q> this film would end best on an up note. With John Williams calling back to his original themes in the track <cite>Mischief Managed!</cite> for the last time, that freeze-frame brought a big smile to my face.</p>

    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</cite> comes at a crucial moment for the franchise: whether to uphold the formulaic boundaries exposed in "Chamber of Secrets" or to go above and beyond what is expected. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hogwarts are seen from new eyes. Harry's Wondrous World, also the name for one of Williams' beautiful scores, is illuminating to discover and inhabit again.</p>

                    <p>Rooted in the very creative direction of Alfonso Cuarón, <cite>Prisoner of Azkaban</cite> is an extremely special achievement. It comes at a  tipping point in the stars' real lives and their character counterparts as tweens. With writer Steve Kloves' wonderful writing, Cuarón and Kloves experiment with the trio of characters' emotions whilst furthering the story with tension, laughter, and gravitas - essentially on repeat in different ways - each better than the next. </p>

                    <p>This story centers on Sirius Black - a convict escaping from the highest security prison in all the Wizarding World, Azkaban. <q>Why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?</q> is the central question of Harry's that provides the film with its tension.</p>

                    <p>It has been a long time for me since I have seen a film so gracefully transition from one scene to another, or, in some beautiful cases, one minute to the next. There are moments scattered throughout the film where, for example, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on their daily - hilarious - journey through Hogwarts and then the next moment is a satisfying musical escalation, from Mr. John Williams of course, that rocks Harry to his core.</p>

                    <p>Another focus that demands the entire movie to showcase are the continuing relationships between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The comedic enjoyment from the banter of these three coupled with the emotional stress they undergo could be a film of its own (and it is - see <cite>the Half-Blood Prince</cite> - the best in the series - book and movie). This adventure, in particular, displays that these adventures would not work without them. Their development is quite obviously the best part of this movie.</p>
