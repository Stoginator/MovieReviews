    				<p><cite>The Batman</cite> is set in the gilded city of Gotham, a place so infested with corruption you begin to feel its claustrophobic effect on its citizens. All the basic institutions are visible - the mayor, the district attorney, and the police - but their operations are opaque. They’ve been <q>doing their job</q> for twenty years, yet the streets of Gotham tell a story of carnage.</p>

                    <p>Criminals control the streets. Elections are futile attempts to change the outcome. A hidden cabal has replaced the people’s rule. You may ask, <q>Is there no end to this city’s depravity?</q> However, the citizens of Gotham do not. They <em>know</em> nothing will change. If you felt that the Gotham City of Christopher Nolan’s <cite>The Dark Knight Trilogy</cite> was beyond saving, writer-director Matt Reeve’s iteration will give you a run for your money.</p>

                    <p>What happens to reasonable people when they have had it? You may not like the answer, but <cite>The Batman</cite> is brutally honest about it. Vigilantes are forced to take affairs into their own hands. Do not be mistaken: this version of the Batman is not who you think he is.</p>

                    <p>In a twenty-minute opening sequence, <cite>The Batman</cite> establishes two characters whose destiny will be interwoven. Unexpectedly, the Riddler’s breath commences the film – and we see him realize the first step of his master plan. When the Riddler murders the mayor, his breathing becomes euphoric – as if this crime is the most satisfying moment in his life. Even though his symbol is unknown to the people, the Riddler is in the driver’s seat.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>In contrast, Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) narrates his experience as the Batman: <q>Two years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal.</q> For criminals everywhere, the shadows have become a vessel of fear. The Batman may be lurking there. But the shadows do not scare the Riddler.</p>

                    <p>When Batman finally appears onscreen, a group of thugs are in disbelief as their leader yells out, <q>The hell are you supposed to be?</q> Batman seizes the thug leader and demolishes him with a battering. Then, he whispers, <q>I’m vengeance.</q></p>

                    <p>In a gladiatorial clash, Batman brutally finishes off the thugs. Yet after the fight is over, he does not offer a hand to their victim; rather, Batman stares at him – and then sees the bat signal hitting the sky. We know why.</p>

                    <p>Batman arrives in the mayor’s penthouse, where he was murdered. For the Gotham City Police Department, the Batman is an unwanted guest. His meticulous, steady eyes illustrate his status as the world’s greatest detective – a cinematically fresh take of Batman pulled straight from the comics. The Riddler has begun something, but what and why?</p>

                    <p>Eventually, the police commissioner arrives and forces Batman to leave. Before he exits, Batman sees the mayor’s orphaned son sitting in another room. The young boy looks back. But the orphan has not caught the Batman’s gaze… it is Bruce Wayne’s.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>For every film, exposition is an essential, yet tricky task. How can the world of the film be established, while keeping the audience dramatically engaged? Given the popularity of the character and his universe, audiences are in tune with the critical details. Reeves establishes the dueling characters, so we understand what version of the Batman this film is about. Underneath the cowl, this Batman is still a child, still dealing with the scars of his parent’s unfortunate murder so many years ago. With Michael Giacchino’s outstanding soundtrack, <cite>The Batman</cite>’s opening minutes become a breathtaking masterpiece.</p>

                    <p>In nearly three-hours, what amazes me is how political the film is – as it initiates a contest of ideas as an undercurrent to its main detective story. Naturally, all of us are more attuned to the Batman’s point of view. However, in the background of the Batman’s search for answers about the city’s past, a one-sided public debate rages in Gotham City. The Riddler publicizes the illicit behavior of city officials and undermines the credibility of the Wayne family. When Bruce Wayne arrives at the mayor’s funeral, protestors crowd the entry way holding the Riddler’s symbol: a giant question mark. Quickly, the Riddler ascends to the level of a political figure because he symbolizes retribution for the pain and suffering of the past two decades – as well as a very specific and violent response. Who else is addressing the people’s concerns?</p>

                    <p>Until the end, the Batman is not ready to take a public stand, so the film’s construction makes us reconsider our feelings. In the heat of the night, as the tapestry of the Riddler’s actions unfolds, my understanding of his character transformed. There is more than malice in him. When people feel ignored and disregarded, what side of them is more easily activated? <cite>The Batman</cite> makes you feel the justified anger shared my many in Gotham City and makes it easy to sympathize with their instinct to burn everything down. As we understand the severity of moral decay, you may want to join them.</p>

                    <p>Upon my original viewing in an IMAX theater in March 2022, I remember my astonishment at the political relevance of the film. As the United States was exiting the COVID-19 pandemic and still reckoning with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">January 6, 2021</a>, the sense of hopelessness that the Riddler embodies was common across the United States. The subject matter was unfortunately timely; in a way, <cite>The Batman</cite> is a time capsule storing those emotions.</p>

                    <p>Smack dab in the middle of this political story is one of the best car chases I have ever seen. Elevated by Giacchino’s Highway to the Anger Zone, the Penguin tries to escape the Batman’s grip on an interstate. Crossing medians, slamming into cars, and tipping trucks, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/roger-deakins-oscars-best-cinematography-not-nominated-breaking-baz-1235286295/">the phenomenal cinematography</a> keeps the reckless action close to camera. A heavy barrage of rain maintains a mood of gloominess. It is an electrifying scene hidden inside a larger story of uncovering political graft.</p>

                    <p>The most damning moment of the film is the largest question posed to Batman. After a major attack on the city, the Batman and Catwoman (Zoë Kravitz) fight off heavily armed vigilantes who organized to assassinate the new mayor-elect. Commissioner Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) removes the mask of one goon, revealing a bloodied face. Gordon repeats the same question posed to Batman in the opening minutes: <q>Who the hell are you?</q></p>

                    <p>The unmasked man says, <q>Me? I’m vengeance.</q></p>

                    <p>In a few words, we understand how Batman’s symbol was used against him. In two years of fighting criminals, he never solved the root cause. Instead, he inspired other vigilantes to go further than he ever did. Prepared to kill anyone in their way, the Riddler’s acolytes tried to destroy the system. How does Batman permanently reclaim his symbol?</p>

                    <p>At times, <cite>The Batman</cite> feels like a political election about <em>who</em> can truly save the city. The Riddler stood on one side, showcasing the city’s corruption, and building a case to burn everything to the ground. The Batman and the mayor-elect stand at the other pole, seeking to guide Gotham City away from its vices. Their stance is to rebuild. I hope Matt Reeves continues to lean in to the politics to elevate the contest for Gotham’s soul.</p>

                    <p>As we shall see in 2026’s <cite>The Batman - Part II</cite>, this fight is not over. The Batman has earned more clarity on his role in Gotham City – to be a symbol of hope against a tide of chaos. However, with a city that has been devoured and is in a state of emergency, will they listen to a forward-looking message of restoration or succumb to a tale of vengeance? Even the Batman did. Now, he must change the story of the city. Can Bruce Wayne do it?</p>
