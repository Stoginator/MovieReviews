                <p><q class="review-subtitle">The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.</q> - Chris Hedges</p>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>After introducing the film’s guiding lens in the form of a quote, <cite>The Hurt Locker</cite> thrusts the audience into a modern day war zone: the streets of Iraq. We are introduced to the soldiers of Bravo Company investigating suspected explosives in the middle of a town. All of the familiar trappings of war films are present: the camaraderie, snarky jokes, heroism. But the clichés only last for a few minutes. When Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pierce) puts on the “bomb-proof” kevlar suit, the signature traits of this film come into play and never let go. <cite>The Hurt Locker</cite> is the antithesis to the major Hollywood war films of years past.</p>

                    <p>Helicopters swirl above. Civilians keep poking their heads out while the squad keeps an eye out for the trigger-man. Every step Thompson takes towards the bomb builds the threat against his life. That fear of detonation - the imagination that this dangerous device could go off - feels real and visceral. Yet, as we discover, the same fear is the sustenance for others. And, when the bomb explodes, it is not the rubble that kills Thompson. It is the sheer force of the explosion. The world we inhabit is one where men are employed to face their own mortality.</p>

                    <p>From a thought-provoking script by Mark Boal and superbly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, <cite>The Hurt Locker</cite> is in a word: turbulent. At its core, it is a character study as we partake in the journey of the bomb squad: Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Almost every day, this company is called upon to defuse bombs. Because of the inherent closeness between living and dying, the tension that pervades the film is all-consuming. The lines are blurred by lapses in judgement - who’s the enemy, where’s the detonator, how much time is left? </p>

                    <p>What the film does exceptionally well is create empathy for these men who all eventually become products of the constant environment of war. The characters are a spectrum of battle tolerance. The eyes of James reveal an adrenaline-junkie who loves the rush of fear, the challenge of defusing bombs, and being on the precipice of dying. His courage is unmistakable, but his conviction is a flaw as it endangers his company men. On the opposite end, Eldridge is an officer fulfilling his duties, but struggles and eventually succumbs to the weight of his work under James. In the middle, Sanborn is the balance - he tolerates James’s lust for field work until the end of the tour. He leaves with what little of his soul he still has.</p>

                    <p>The downtime between jobs is as illuminating as the jobs themselves. For the soldiers, the experiences cling to them and entirely prevent any sense of normalcy. For the audience, the lack of tension and adrenaline is taxing; the slowness is irritating. Just as the soldiers acclimate to extraordinary situations, we cannot settle for anything less. The job possesses you. A commanding officer asks James, <q>How many bombs have you disarmed?</q> After dodging, James answers, “Eight-hundred seventy-three.” What happens to a man when his purpose is to game death?</p>

                    <p>When Bravo Company finishes their tour, everyone returns home, but for James, the desire to keep working remains. James faces death enough so that the idea of dying becomes a contest. The closer he gets, the better the rush of victory. Nobody - not his company men or his family - can get in his way. And, in his eyes, you can glimpse the corrosive nature of war.</p>
