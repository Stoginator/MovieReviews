    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>In the film business, a director’s second feature can be more important than their first. Writer-director Celine Song’s first film, 2023’s <cite>Past Lives</cite>, was a remarkable debut, showcasing a brave and steady hand behind the camera. With her sophomore outing, 2025’s <cite>Materialists</cite>, she doubles down on the primary topic which has interested her so far: Romance in the modern age.</p>

                    <p>Celine Song is fascinated by our thought processes around love. <cite>Past Lives</cite> was about how your personal history echoes into the present. Paths not taken, especially with romantic partners, never really leave us. They resonate beyond the moments in time they occupy.</p>

                    <p><cite>Materialists</cite> is equally meditative, refusing to be a typical romantic comedy that marches forward only with one-liners and odd situations. Song returns to a love triangle. She has assembled a three-star package with Lucy (Dakota Johnson), John (Chris Evans), and Harry (Pedro Pascal).</p>

                    <p>Lucy is a matchmaker who deals with clients like stocks. Investors value a company’s stock using attributes like dividend yield, price-to-earnings ratio, and earnings-per-share. In the same way, Lucy’s matchmaking service has commodified clients, searching for a soulmate with the perfect combination of height, body type, education level, political affiliation, income, and attractiveness. Stock pickers would be out of work if they were this picky.</p>

                    <p>Every character in this story wrestles with this societal myth: Your soulmate will match your list of desires. Lucy is on the frontlines of this battle. She feeds into their fantasies of finding that special somebody with the perfect combination, making love seem as simple as checking boxes. Since she spends her day selling dreams, she starts to believe what she says.</p>

                    <p>The villain is silent, neither mentioned nor seen: Society. By applying the language of finance to modern romance, characters look at their potential mates like stocks, which peak in their twenties and fall forever after. In <cite>Materialists</cite>, society has taught the characters to value tangible attributes above all else. This cold-blooded analysis turns cruel.</p>

                    <p>Even the ones who talk about intangibles, like having someone that makes you grow, don’t realize they are contradicting themselves. Watch everyone’s choices, which tell a different story than their words. Everyone knows how the game must be played.</p>

                    <p>That is the neat trick of <cite>Materialists</cite>. As these characters speak in circles about their desires in a partner, we go with it. We become complicit in society’s game: The myth that if you check the box on every tangible attribute for each other, you are a match. Or should I say, an asset. Even if we say we don’t believe, are we being truthful to ourselves?</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A_kmjtsJ7c">Based on the trailer</a>, I went into the theater expecting a typical romantic comedy. My mistake. Who approved the trailer? It is sending audiences in with the wrong idea. Once I broke the rom-com mold, everything fell into place.</p>

                    <p><cite>Materialists</cite> is Celine Song’s version of an op-ed. Rather than presenting her argument in a newspaper, she taps her filmmaking skills to encase commentary about modern romance in a dramatic story.</p>

                    <p>Song maintains the grammar of romance films. For example, <cite>Materialists</cite> is filled with two-shots of a couple, allowing each of us to edit the film by focusing on the character of our choice at any time. Daniel Pemberton’s score is thematic, using the same theme in contrasting situations to suggest how a character has changed. As the film progresses, the structure of a rom-com becomes evident, but the route to the end is surprising.</p>

                    <p>There is a reason the chemistry between couples feels off in <cite>Materialists</cite>. When we watch 1987’s <cite>The Princess Bride</cite>, 1989’s <cite>When Harry Met Sally</cite>, or 2017’s <cite>Phantom Thread</cite>, something catches the chords of our hearts. However, scenes in <cite>Materialists</cite> that traditionally soar with romantic power do not.</p>

                    <p>Celine Song knows how to switch on the chemistry; it happens in <cite>Materialists</cite> at the right moments, even without any words. What astonishes me is how devoid of romance she can make affairs. It is purposeful emptiness. In the end, it becomes clear why.</p>

                    <p>My favorite idea in Song’s film is about the origins of marriage. It may be a common conception that marriage began as a business proposition, to obtain a dowry in the form of more cows, more acreage, or as a bridge between nations. Here, Song’s deep optimism shines through, calling out in filmic terms: “We marry because of love.” In <cite>Materialists</cite>, she has created characters who are confused about how to find love. To them, love is a scary word that should not be uttered. Even though Song is fundamentally different from her own characters, she captures their essence. That is one mark of a great filmmaker.</p>

                    <p>Based on that, who does Lucy pick: Harry (Pedro Pascal), the unicorn in private equity, or John (Chris Evans), the one with two roommates? You might think you know Lucy’s decision. Her journey offers much to ponder about modern romance. Hopefully, a rethink is coming soon.</p>
