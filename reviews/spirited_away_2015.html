    				<p>Do filmmakers know what their movie will become? From writing to production design, do directors have any clue? Well all I can say is that Miyazaki probably did with <cite>Spirited Away</cite>. A beautiful masterclass piece of cinema that will stand as the animation milestone.</p>

                    <p>Miyazaki's world in <cite>Spirited Away</cite> is realized to its utmost potential, and considerable potential there is. No detail is left unconsidered and the world is beautifully rendered with such realistic people. My beliefs were never suspended during this two-hour movie which is a lot to say. The movie hooked me straight in and caught me after what felt like minutes.</p>

                    <p><cite>Spirited Away</cite> makes everyone regain a level of curiosity in the world. We are so used to our place, this teaches us to break out of our comfort zones, even if they aren't as crazy. But, also the feeling of curiosity in a child. Chihiro, the main character, wonders with her mother and father into an "abandoned theme park." Why don't we learn first and then make assumptions, it should never be the other way. Chihiro's parents quickly find their way to a restaurant and are turned into pigs for eating food not intended for them. Chihiro is now stuck conflicted and shaken out of apathy.</p>

                    <p>What Miyazaki excels so brilliantly at is developing Chihiro as a real girl. Innocent, sometimes demanding. All will find her relatable and she will spring memories of childhood in people. Her importance on friends and family is a bright contrast to the greed and corruption of adults. It's true, most of us lose that feeling of being a child where we are left speechless over simple pleasures like eating bacon for the first time and not monetary pleasures.</p>

                    <p>I first saw this movie as a small child and I vividly remember certain scenes wowing me and some scaring me sideways. That is the difference between then me and now me it seems. Kids' emotions are much more potent and seem to disappear with age. Now, this is the level Miyazaki can make his audience think. Not surprising considering he inspired a generation of animators. Miyazaki hasn't lost his sense of being a child and for his little gift back I am truly grateful. Movies were meant to convey feeling, even in the silent era. Miyazaki does movies right, and even though it is sad he has retired, his films retain what made him a child inside.</p>
