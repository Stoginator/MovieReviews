    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>We are lucky to watch <cite>Mickey 17</cite> in a movie theater. It is a 100 million dollar sci-fi comedy green-lit by Warner Bros. Studios, featuring A-list actors, written and directed by a Korean auteur (who had final cut), featuring unmarketable, adult-oriented subject matter. By any measure, this is an improbable film in Hollywood today.</p>

                    <p>As a general rule in the film industry of 2025, marshaling such a scale of resources is rarely seen outside of superhero films or franchise fare. To diversify their investment risk, studios typically release five to ten low-budget films a year, any of which could over-perform at the box office. A rising tide for one lifts all boats.</p>

                    <p>However, the opportunity cost for a major Hollywood studio to divert these resources to a single big-budget, original film carries heavy risk - especially one this unusual. In anticipation of <cite>Mickey 17</cite>’s release, all the other studios were waiting in the wild, wondering whether audiences will show up, ready to receive the economic message loud and clear.</p>

                    <p>On a 118 million dollar budget, <cite>Mickey 17</cite>’s domestic opening weekend was 19 million dollars. Moreover, it is a near certainty that <cite>Mickey 17</cite> will not recoup its budget at the global box office. This is unfortunate news for lovers of bold, original films: The audience did not come out for one of the biggest bets this year. That message will echo in Hollywood for some time. We may never know what doors will close in reaction to its underperformance.</p>

                    <p><cite>Mickey 17</cite>’s lack of financial success was more likely than not. This is why the film’s mere existence is so unlikely. Its tone is so wacky that <cite>Mickey 17</cite> is unmarketable; no trailer, TV spot, or social media promotion with Dean Martin’s <cite>Ain’t That a Kick in The Head</cite> could have raised its economic tide.</p>

                    <p>The writer-director of Mickey 17 is Korean auteur Boon Jong Ho, who became an international sensation after 2019’s <cite>Parasite</cite> won Best Picture at the 2020 Oscars. That phenomenon allowed his previous work to be re-discovered, uncovering specific topics that he continues to tell stories about: ethical dilemmas, animal treatment, and the chasm between workers and rulers. <cite>Mickey 17</cite> continues this legacy.</p>

                    <p>Now, with all the backstory covered, aren’t you interested in giving this film a chance?</p>

                    <p>The tone of <cite>Mickey 17</cite> is unique; I see it as a mixture of 2009’s <cite>Avatar</cite>, with its full-hearted belief in the goodness of nature, 2020’s <cite>Don’t Look Up</cite>, with its satirical take on mankind’s response to impending doom, and the dark humor of Quentin Tarantino - where you laugh at events you never thought you would. While the influences are clear, Bong Joon Ho has made something that is entirely his own.</p>

                    <p>I tried to predict where the film was going, but I gave up very early. <cite>Mickey 17</cite> is so much more fun when you let go and get sucked in.</p>

                    <p>In his first role since 2022’s <cite>The Batman</cite>, Robert Pattinson gives us a consistently entertaining performance as Mickey, with a high-pitched voice that we learn to take seriously. Throughout the film, Pattinson plays multiple versions of the same character. How so? Mickey is an Expendable, a person who is contractually obligated to risk his life. Hence, Mickey dies very often. Don’t worry - he is easily printed back to life by a human printer, a miraculous invention used for sorry purposes.</p>

                    <p>You can do anything to an Expendable. Mickey loses his hand, gets exposed to poisonous gases, and dumped into an incinerator at the end of his lives. There is a good joke hidden in this routine. When humanity understands biology and physics so well that we can restore humans from a hard drive, we use this tool for stupid tests on distant planets. That's due to the whims of one man.</p>

                    <p>Kenneth Marshall (Mark Ruffalo) is a narcissistic politician, who seeks to uses Expendables to colonize distant planets and create a human race of his own “spawn.” Using his platform, he lobbies an outraged public to send him into space and accept only two restrictions on the tool:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There shall be no Expendables on Earth.</li>
                        <li>You cannot print a new human while a copy is alive.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Such a machine raises deep philosophical questions about the value of life. Things matter because time is scarce. So, what happens to the drive we feel to make every second count? Has this machine erased that urge?</p>

                    <p>Yeah, nobody cares anymore. These philosophical ramblings are investigated for about two minutes before we move on to governance of Expendables on new worlds. Mankind’s ADHD in the film is on par for 2025. Underneath <cite>Mickey 17</cite>’s sci-fi elements, this is the film's interesting, satirical core - which is hard to condense into a ten-second promo.</p>

                    <p>Kenneth Marshall is a laughable character, so riddled with an lack of self-awareness that you wonder how someone could be so outrageous. But the laughs dissipated when I realized how much Marshall uses his power to destroy. His self-centeredness leads him to the worst outcomes. The casting of Mark Ruffalo in the role is smart as he brings his history from his previous films - and plays against it. Since it is hard to hate Mark Ruffalo, it becomes hard to hate Kenneth Marshall.</p>

                    <p>Without Marshall, however, there would be no plot in <cite>Mickey 17</cite>. And without the poor workers he hires for his space expedition, Bong Joon Ho would not be able to stack the cast with Toni Collette, Naomi Ackie, and Steven Yeun, one of today’s best leading actors.</p>

                    <p>Boon Joon Ho uses two filmmaking techniques to great effect but not enough. Mickey’s high-pitched voiceover is prominent in the opening scenes of the film, cracking us up, engaging us, and guiding us through the improbable events that led him to life as an Expendable. There are also several montages that compress time and thematically connect events. Combined with Mickey’s voiceover, they were the most entertaining parts of the film. But then the internal monologues disappear - and do not return until the end! How come?</p>

                    <p>On a technical level, however, <cite>Mickey 17</cite> is very impressive. Any computer generated imagery used blends very well with the practical sets. The metallic interiors of the spaceship, the barren winter landscape of the planet Niflheim, and the creature design of its inhabitants are stellar. Boon Jong Ho likes to throw our expectations back at us - and, in <cite>Mickey 17</cite>, he is able to visually turn the tables on us.</p>

                    <p>As the plot of <cite>Mickey 17</cite> escalates, the conflicts between Marshall, his crew, and the natives of Niflheim boil up - and the resolution that follows lacks much meaning. Rather than being a satirical gut-punch that makes us feel the ills of our society, <cite>Mickey 17</cite> simply amounts to a good time. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I thought there would be more depth.</p>

                    <p>While I was leaving the theater, all the focus on powerful men, colonization, and ethical grey-zones felt somewhat hollow. In his previous films, Boon Jong Ho has surprised us with how he creates stories around these ideas, blending genre and exploiting structure to achieve any end. But in <cite>Mickey 17</cite>, his unique style is used in service of a comedy about a wacky mishmash of humans on a far-away planet trying to figure things out.</p>
