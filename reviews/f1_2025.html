                    <p><cite>F1</cite> begins with Led Zeppelin’s <cite>Whole Lotta Love</cite>, a song that has rarely been in a Hollywood film. As a band, Led Zeppelin is extremely restrictive with licensing their music. The use case of their songs has to be just right. When I heard the song and saw how it was used onscreen, I smiled to myself and thought, <q>It’s about damn time.</q></p>

                    <p>In the opening scene, Brad Pitt wakes up from his deep slumber and gears up with his gloves and uniform, preparing to head into a NASCAR stadium for the Daytona 500. He puts on a BMW cap and exits his trailer. A BMW company rep alerts him that the car’s brakes will fail at high temperatures. Good to know.</p>

                    <p>Pitt makes it to his team’s tent and tosses the BMW hat onto a stack with many other brands. He’s not a BMW driver. He’s racing for another team and collecting intel. Yet, he didn’t do anything strictly illegal; he’s just being a fan at a very odd time. If they knew of his exploits, they’d go, “Son of a —”</p>

                    <p>This is Sonny Hayes, the latest addition to Brad Pitt’s collection of leading roles. Sonny is a has-been racer who flamed out before he had the chance to prove his mettle. We find him at a NASCAR race, but, as the title indicates, he gets roped into Formula One.</p>

                    <p>Formula One is an elite sport: the cars are faster, the turns are tighter, and the competition is fiercer. With only ten teams and two drivers per team, the pool of sufficient talent is smaller than any American sport. If you want to see the twenty most skilled drivers in the world compete, Formula One is their chosen arena.</p>

                    <p>With the character of Sonny Hayes, Brad Pitt is operating at the peak of his powers, having blended the qualities of his most famous characters into Sonny. I sense the edge that Tyler Durden had in 1999’s <cite>Fight Club</cite>. I see the strategic wisdom and feel the unresolved trauma of Billy Beane from 2011’s <cite>Moneyball</cite>. Then, there is the steady coolness of Cliff Booth in 2019’s <cite>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</cite>. In each of these roles, Pitt transforms his characters’ silence into dramatic expression; I’ve always found his glances and stares as meaningful as his dialogue. His best roles are expressions of gruffness: succinct dialogue, dealing criticism as good as he gets it, and confronting disagreement head-on. Sonny works the same way.</p>

                    <p>Sonny is a custom character for a very custom movie. After investigating this film’s production history, I believe <cite>F1</cite> has the highest ratio of <em>hours worked to minutes seen</em> of any film in 2025. It is hard to fathom the amount of stakeholder alignment, creative and technical development, preparation, and sheer luck needed to produce the film’s 155 minutes.</p>

                    <p>Development on <cite>F1</cite> began in 2021 with director Joesph Kosinski and driver Lewis Hamilton, both very successful in their industries. In the United States, Kosinski made the highest grossing movie of the decade in 2022’s <cite>Top Gun: Maverick</cite>, which literally saved movie theaters with its legendary post-pandemic summer run. In an entirely different field, Hamilton is the winningest Formula One driver in history, with 105 race wins and 7 year-end championships. Kosinski brought the filmmaking cachet. Hamilton invested his energy into the picture, using his racing expertise to embed nitty-gritty details and ensure authenticity in every aspect of the film.</p>

                    <p>Thus, the filmmaking team assembled around them. Kosinski, Hamilton, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer met with all ten Formula One teams to help them understand what the movie is about. Kosinski worked with Sony to produce bespoke cameras with custom rigs and RF systems to place and control the cameras on cars going 180 miles per hour. Brad Pitt was cast and developed a script with writer Ehren Kruger. Hamilton is so involved, that he went line-by-line in the script to spot inauthenticity.</p>

                    <p>After months of engagement, Bruckheimer eventually convinced the Formula One teams that no one would be vilified. At that point, the teams decided to collaborate with the filmmakers. Mercedes procured and customized Formula Two cars for the crew, which are relatively cheaper and slower compared to Formula One cars. <em>Legally Required Note: Formula Two cars can rocket to a top speed of 180 miles per hour. No giggles on the track.</em></p>

                    <p>Sony’s rigs enabled the camera to be in fifteen different places on the car. The RF systems could control the camera anywhere on the track, allowing for special pans to capture the spatial dynamics in the same shot. The system could combine the raceway, the driver, and the competition in the same shot, while refocusing for all the different focal lengths.</p>

                    <p>Brad Pitt and his onscreen compadre, Damson Idris, learned to drive these cars safely at their top speeds. With these cars, safety can be counterintuitive. Going fast on a curve is actually safer than going slow; the downforce from the high speed keeps the car on the ground. The production’s insurers did not like the idea of Brad Pitt going 180 miles per hour down a straight-away. It took weeks to convince them of basic physics.</p>

                    <p><em>Shush! Don’t tell anyone.</em> Against the insurers’ demands, the crew filmed during those weeks anyway. No crew is falling behind schedule just to please the actuaries.</p>

                    <p>The fruits of the production team’s labor are great. They got access to racetracks on Formula One race days, putting filmmakers in front of actual drivers and real crowds — with all the added pressure. For some shots in <cite>F1</cite>, there was only one take. Everyone had it to get right. You can feel the adrenaline onscreen when you see it. Real-life circumstances boosted the drama. Try getting into character and setting up the shot in front of 100,000 fans.</p>

                    <p>No matter the circumstances of production, the final result is what an audience sees in the movie theater or, more commonly, at home. And, audiences can be unforgiving, which is why this filmmaking team kept their North Star on the viewing experience of <cite>F1</cite>. That intensity of focus ensures none of their effort goes to waste; it also elevates <cite>F1</cite> into the best movie theater experience of the year.</p>

                    <p>I was lucky to view <cite>F1</cite> on the biggest IMAX screen I could find. Each individual element of the film is so well-crafted that the film defies moment-to-moment analysis — it’s too much fun to watch.</p>

                    <p><cite>F1</cite> has a spectacular sound team, who balanced conflicting elements to provide sonic clarity. As I learned from the special features of 2019’s <cite>Ford v. Ferrari</cite>, racing films are hard to sound mix because any car sound effects dominate the low and medium frequencies, leaving only the high frequencies for dialogue and music. If you listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/27qC3KK5wjQzyNenY53fep">Hans Zimmer’s main title track</a>, you’ll clearly hear that the track heavily skews toward higher frequencies. This is very intentional.</p>

                    <p>Sonic accuracy was paramount to the sound team. Lewis Hamilton consulted on how the cars should sound on all 9 Formula One racetracks in the film. Sonny Hayes drives the same car on each track, but a side-by-side comparison will reveal the sonic textures, which change with weather, tire health, and track composition. More impressively, on a first-time viewing, all the dialogue, music, and sound effects felt incredibly clear and immersive — which means the sound team delivered against difficult circumstances.</p>

                    <p>To capture this sprawling film which spans ten countries, Kosinski reunited with his longtime cinematographer, Claudio Miranda, who excels in visual composition. <cite>F1</cite> is a beautiful film to view — pick any still and just gaze. Miranda knows where how to direct the human eye to the essence of a frame, which is an essential for a film that moves fast.</p>

                    <p>Editor Stephen Mirrione cuts <cite>F1</cite> at a lightning pace, refusing to let any scene last longer than the story demands and making two-and-a-half hours disappear. In dialogue scenes, Mirrione tends to hold shots either because the camera is moving, characters are moving, or the frame deserves to be scanned with our eyes.</p>

                    <p>During Formula One races, Mirrione maximizes our sense of velocity with very quick cuts. Given my engagement in the story, these races have a pulsating tempo that caused my heart rate to rise. The film effortlessly bounces between perspectives of driver and car, spectators, and team members by satisfying our sense of spatial awareness. Miranda’s composition makes it easy to know where every character is positioned. The editing pace is a harmonious balance of Gen-Z and traditional Hollywood sensibilities, enabled by a deep collaboration with cinematography.</p>

                    <p>Writer Ehren Kruger wrote <cite>Top Gun: Maverick</cite> a few years ago. It’s no surprise that <cite>F1</cite> uses the same dramatic structure —  and why not? Change the lead actor, the environment, and the technical details but maintain the circumstances: a has-been given one more chance at glory, a rookie with a chip on his shoulder, a love interest with intellect and great comedic timing, and memorable supporting players. Yes, <cite>F1</cite> copies a Hollywood film archetype like <cite>Top Gun: Maverick</cite> but who cares when it’s this much fun.</p>

                    <p>I am fascinated by Brad Pitt’s dialogue across all his films. I have been sending my regards to the screenwriter, but, after all these years, I was mistaken. Pitt works with many writers, yet the common denominator has always been him. Take this encounter in <cite>F1</cite> between his character and the team’s technical director, Kate (Kerry Condon):</p>

                        <li class="dialogue">Okay, Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Aston, now McLaren, all have us beat on the straights. Our shot is battling in the turns. We need to build our car for combat.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This format of dialogue, where Pitt’s character is thinking a couple steps ahead of the audience and the other characters in the scene, is the lifeblood of his work. It works so effortlessly and feels so dramatically compelling that I am a sucker for it every single time. These lines capture the essence of Sonny Hayes:</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">SONNY</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">There’s twenty other drivers still out on that track. You think any of them respect us?</li>

                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">SONNY</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Hey! You lose that lead and I’ll kill ya.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The depth of Sonny’s character is one indication of many that distinguishes how <cite>F1</cite> was made. For the thousands of hours put into production calls, technical improvements, and post-production, everyone was striving towards the same goal: telling the best story possible in 155 minutes. Don’t be fooled: This is very hard. In all the logistical chaos of making a film of such scale, how do you maintain clear-eyed focus on the story?</p>

                    <p>That is a question for the masters behind <cite>F1</cite>. All their hard work behind the scenes has paid off in stunning fashion. As I left the theater, I said to my brother, <q>Can we do that again?</q></p>
