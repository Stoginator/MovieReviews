                <q class="review-subtitle">You're not Steve Rogers.</q>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>It has been almost six years since the release of 2019’s <cite>Avengers: Endgame</cite>. In that time, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has added thirteen films and thirteen television shows to its catalogue. Most filmgoers would struggle to name them all the films, let alone all the new shows. I can’t. It is all too much.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>Captain America: Brave New World</cite>, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) dons the uniform and the mantle of the departed and beloved Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). This movie could have changed the ongoing narrative of exhaustion, but it only takes a few minutes of the film to understand: This one ain’t doing it.</p>

                    <p>The film opens with a bland political speech given by President-Elect Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford). As is customary, this is followed by a been-there, done-that extraction of a metal cylinder, better known as a “goober.” Sam Wilson is tasked with obtaining the goober and taking out some bad guys. Who are the bad guys? What’s the goober? That’s classified. No exposition is provided. We are expected to watch people fighting completely out of context.</p>

                    <p>Given there are five screenwriters credited on <cite>Captain America: Brave New World</cite>, it is somewhat surprising how badly the film suffers from a severe lack of emotional stakes. Couldn’t anyone discover a reason to care?</p>

                    <p>The best solution the film can find is digging into the MCU’s lore, bringing back a trio of characters from 2008’s <cite>The Incredible Hulk</cite>, whose version of Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton, was recasted by producer Kevin Feige. Therein lies the MCU’s new bane: The hard-core fans will love the lore-dropping, but the rest of us… are awfully confused.</p>

                    <p>Kevin Feige, the man responsible for much of the MCU’s cultural success, is often asked how he created such a bold universe of characters onscreen. His response: <q>Focus on one movie at a time.</q> That was the winning recipe that fostered 2012’s <cite>The Avengers</cite> - and the improbable string of mega-successes that followed.</p>

                    <p>Looking at <cite>Captain America: Brave New World</cite>, elements pulled from the broader MCU have become a constant distraction. Characters from previous films make half-baked appearances. Steve Rogers keeps getting discussed, taking us out of the movie and making us ask ourselves, <q>Why didn’t we rewatch 2014’s <cite>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</cite>?</q> Everyone in this film misses Steve Rogers. Well, so do we.</p>

                    <p>Sam Wilson is a superhero with imposter syndrome. As a regular human who hasn’t taken super-serum, he wonders whether he is enough to take on the mantle for Steve Rogers. Frankly, it feels like a forced debate: he already has the suit and the shield. Would he really give that up?</p>

                    <p>Besides the character callbacks, there are even more new characters introduced, whose characterization inevitably feels thin. There are replacements for everyone in Steve Rogers’ original entourage: Falcon, Black Widow, and Agent Carter. None get much screen time - nor do they feel like emotional equivalents. This is the problem.</p>

                    <p>Even Harrison Ford, who played another American president in the 1997 action classic, <cite>Air Force One</cite>, cannot resuscitate this film out of a deep slumber. The limited emotional pull he offers is an estrangement with his daughter, Betty, the ex-lover of Bruce Banner. That never amounts to much, either.</p>

                    <p>Sure, stuff happens in this film, but it's nothing that the audience won’t forget by the next day. The president is attacked, the U.S. fights an ally in open waters, and Captain America saves the day. Kids might sense novelty, but the rest of us have seen this rodeo before.</p>

                    <p>With <cite>Captain America: Brave New World</cite>, the jury is now out. It is time to stop expecting audiences to transplant their goodwill from previous stories onto “new” films. The way to grow your audience is not to shove in references from the past or start stories on the small screen that culminate on the big screen. <b>The MCU needs to start over.</b></p>

                    <p>In 2018, director Martin Scorsese, the man behind 1978’s <cite>Taxi Driver</cite> and 1990’s <cite>Goodfellas</cite>, was asked about the MCU. His response: <q>I don’t think they’re cinema.</q> For a time, the rhetoric within the cinema world was divisive.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><em>Marvel Fan</em>: “How dare he? He’s made the same gangster movie fifty times.”</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><em>Scorsese Fan</em>: “Marvel movies are theme-park rides. There’s nothing new in them.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Scorsese was talking about how Marvel movies absorbed all the screens at the cineplex. There was no room in the film executive’s head to fund other types of movies - which affected his career.</p>

                    <p>At the time, the debate was ancillary to me. If I was asked, “Which film did I like better: <cite>Taxi Driver</cite> or <cite>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</cite>?” I would write-in “All of the above.”</p>

                    <p>Seven years later, I see what Scorsese was trying to say about the movies themselves. They are variations on the same structure: a chase for a goober, a superhero gone rogue, an enemy on the inside, a climactic battle as the finale. These films are starting to blend together. There is little that differentiates them anymore. Not even a Red Hulk that looks like Harrison Ford can save this movie. Because we never get a good enough answer: Why should we care about him?</p>

                    <p>The reason that Sam Wilson’s imposter syndrome fell flat is because we know the answer is predetermined. Marvel Studios makes more money with him in the suit. So, of course, the ending will lead to him feeling better about wearing it.</p>

                    <p>Marvel films never used to feel like they were solely financial products. They had heart, with great casting and stories around characters that could fail - and grow from it. Even Steve Rogers made some big mistakes. Today, they are so insistent on chasing past glories that nothing can take root. The Marvel Cinematic Universe needs a course correction fast.</p>

                    <p>Kevin Feige must know this: It is time to start fresh. Retire the heroes we loved. The band of characters that could be used is so plentiful and so varied. You can pull something new out of the universe. Give us some new souls to love - and challenge them. Show us how they attempt to navigate personal crises.</p>

                    <p>However, to Scorsese’s point, that may be too large of a risk. Think of such a project landing on the desk of a Disney executive: You want me to green-light a two-hundred-million dollar movie about some superhero no one has ever heard about?</p>

                    <p>At this mega-blockbuster scale, any added risk is a hard sell. Why bother doing something new, without a built-in fanbase, when you can recycle the old and make more money?</p>

                    <p>Then again, with this financial logic, you would have never gotten 2008’s <cite>Iron Man</cite> or 2014’s <cite>Guardians of the Galaxy</cite>. If risk-free recycling is name of the game, then the audience’s goodwill will only last so long.</p>

                    <p>It’s time to make some bold decisions again.</p>
