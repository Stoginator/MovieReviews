    				<p>I am beginning to pick up on a few trends which pervade Taylor Sheridan’s work. All of the stories which he chooses to tell are brutally honest in depicting places and characters which have a lot lurking beneath the surface. They highlight what you can call the gray areas - where the good guys don’t look so good anymore and the bad guys somehow seem justified in their actions. The choices facing his characters are gritty - there never really is a clean cut solution, is there? And most of all, there is a feeling of sustained tension that hits me in the stomach (although, the director Denis Villeneuve no doubt played a major role here). Not only does <cite>Sicario</cite> reinforce these trends, it gives you a lot to think about.</p>

                    <p><cite>Sicario</cite> focuses on the escalating drug war on the U.S.-Mexico border through two perspectives: the first is an American Task force containing an F.B.I agent named Kate (Emily Blunt) and two “advisors” named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) and Matt (Josh Brolin) and the other is a Mexican family. The beginning of the film places you in the shoes of Kate when she volunteers to join a task force dedicated to pinning down a Mexican drug lord. Like the audience, Kate begins to see just how much she doesn’t know. Another thing I like about the film is that it never stops to reflect on what happens - it only continues the story and unraveling the characters. I guess you can call that “relentless storytelling.”</p>

                    <p>The film does not shy away from reality. Sheridan’s screenplay is brutal, and Villeneuve’s work on screen follows suit. The rule of law near the border is nonexistent. On the Mexican side, the drug cartels have corrupted the police force and hang beheaded people in the streets. In this war, even civilians are not safe. Mothers and fathers may not come home to their kids. Families live in a war zone where gunshots are distracting, but a fact of life. The poorest are the ones who suffer as they send their loved ones to do the dirty business of the drug lords. Where this dynamic exists, another one is present on the American side. The government task force operates with no boundaries and the bureaucracy in place not only covers up the truth, but accepts it occurs. In the end, the goal was never to end drug shipments over the border - but to be able to control it. Illegal and immoral practices - torturing, the killing of civilians and children - all occur by our hand. The rule of law is just as barbaric. Although, lawfulness seems to exist on the surface, <cite>Sicario</cite> pulls back the curtain.</p>

                    <p>While the film has amazing depth, it is also a great thing to watch. Taylor Sheridan’s vision on paper is as complex as it is striking. Denis Villeneuve took it and translated it to the screen extraordinarily well. With the help of the legendary cinematographer, Roger Deakins, <cite>Sicario</cite> is successful. The late composer, Johann Johansson, gives the film an atmospheric score meant to give weight to the tension.  Also, I’d be remiss if I did not mention Benicio Del Toro’s performance. His character, Alejandro, does not speak much, but when he does, it can be as profound as it is emotional. It’s a large range to cover as well as an interesting character to play and Del Toro did a remarkable job. </p>
