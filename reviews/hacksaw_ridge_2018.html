    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>I like to think that I have seen many films. But, when it comes to films that depict war, I must admit I fall especially short. Films are meant to transport us away from our own life - and the best ones engross us in their story. This film’s director, Mel Gibson, does not shy away from showing us the reality of the battlefield, and by the end of the film, you understand that he has good reason to do so.</p>

                    <p>The film focuses on the true story of Desmond Doss (a powerful performance by Andrew Garfield), a young man who enlists in the Army as a “Conscientious Objector” - meaning he does not wield a weapon because he objects to kill. Doss says, <q>While everybody else is taking life, I’m going to be saving it.</q> During World War II, this was in no way a popular decision. Society is pitted against Doss leading them to question his intention, his conviction, and his resolve. But Doss - the classic underdog - finds a way to the frontlines, and defies everyone’s expectations by saving the lives of seventy-five men.</p>

                    <p>The war seems like a character in itself. Doss’s father (played by Hugo Weaving), a veteran from World War I, reminds us of the horror, pain, and loss that comes with war before we ever see a battlefield. And when the chaos begins, Gibson uses it to lend even more weight to Doss’s heroics, but also of his company. Gibson finds space to emphasize the fact that all men on the battlefield are people, no matter whether they carry an American flag or a Japanese one. Yet, <cite>Hacksaw Ridge</cite> also contains some extraordinary moments of levity in between the battle, where Doss and his comrade, Ryker, engage in conversation. More so than the violence, it is the human element of the war that sticks with me. In the end, every life saved counts - no matter whose it is.</p>

                    <p>The message of this film feels extremely timely, yet perhaps that is because it is a message that is also eternal. It is best said by Doss’s comrade, Ryker: <q>I learned how to hate quick. Learned how to judge people quick. And I got you very wrong.</q> This is one hell of a movie. </p>
