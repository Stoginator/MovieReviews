    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>At 2:17am on a school night, seventeen kids in a suburban community run out the doors of their homes with their arms held out. The house alarms go off, the Ring cameras catch them, but the parents are too late to their doors. Those kids have gone straight into the darkness, running like hell. Why did this happen? Where are the kids? Are they still alive?</p>

                    <p>The disappeared ones all came from the same class. Only one child and their teacher were spared. Why only them? At a school conference, one of the parents is furious. His name is Archer (Josh Brolin):</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">ARCHER</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">We’re talking about seventeen kids in one classroom. I want to know what happened in that classroom. Why just her classroom? Why only her’s?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>He is talking about Justine (Julia Garner), their teacher. To the parents, she is the main suspect. To the police detectives, she’s clean. Yet we wonder: Who is she? And where are those kids?</p>

                    <p>That is the dramatic situation of <cite>Weapons</cite>, which is being advertised as a horror movie. Does it sound like a horror movie? To many parents, absolutely. Though, <cite>Weapons</cite> works because it uses horror elements as a connective tissue for other genres.</p>

                    <p>Its premise seduces us as a crime thriller, making us think hard about the location of those kids. Over time, it morphs into an ensemble piece, as we spend time understanding the different characters in the community. The ensemble nature works because these characters are competent. While they have character flaws, their decisions are relatable — ones I’d likely make in their shoes. Moreover, the ensemble cast is stacked! Alden Ehrenreich, Benedict Wong, Austin Abrams, Amy Madigan, and newcomer Cary Christopher are others in memorable roles.</p>

                    <p>Rounding out the film’s core, traditional horror elements like jump scares, eerie music, and drawn-out silence sweeten the pot. <cite>Weapons</cite> is so well-constructed that it made me realize: After watching a good horror movie, have you ever wondered why being home alone is scary? When the experience is over, what stays with us that makes us afraid?</p>

                    <p><em>It’s the silence!</em> The quiet always draws us in before a jump scare. While <cite>Weapons</cite> is not filled cheap jump scares, writer-director Zach Cregger knows how to earn his use of silence.</p>

                    <p>Some horror movies never <em>earn</em> their jump scares. In those films, we couldn't care less about the characters; we may feel little to no intrigue about where the plot is headed. By properly setting up the dramatic structure of <cite>Weapons</cite>, Cregger makes the silence all the more effective. We want to see around that corner. We want the camera to turn. Even if, after it does, we might scream. <cite>Weapons</cite> is yet another example that proves the best horror movies are not exclusively about the horror.</p>

                    <p>By setting its story in suburban America, <cite>Weapons</cite> locks itself to a known internal logic. The rules and progression of this story must feel possible within local diners, neighborhoods, school buses, and classrooms. As the twists and turns unfold, there is a certain “Oh, shit!” dynamic from the level of surprise we feel. I know this world well, but <cite>Weapons</cite> outsmarted me time and time again.</p>

                    <p>When it ends, much of the satisfaction is derived from its feeling of total closure and elusiveness. The ending is so complete, yet I could not call it ahead of time. With this story, it seems Zach Cregger constrained himself to known knowns: suburbia, typical jobs in teaching and construction, and everyday routines for his characters. Out of those constraints birthed great creativity. I tried to get ahead of the film, but what Zach Cregger imagined was much better. I learned to just enjoy the ride.</p>

                    <p><cite>Weapons</cite> is a fantastic case study in a simple, yet oft-noticed rule of filmmaking: Reward the audience for their attention. With such a compelling premise about missing children, Cregger forces you to pay attention. If you stick around, you will walk out of the theater feeling rewarded for it — and go home scared of being alone in the silence.</p>

                    <p>You never know what lurks beneath the surface in suburban America.</p>
