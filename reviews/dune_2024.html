    				<p>The epic scope of director Denis Villeneuve’s <cite>Dune</cite> is so magnificent that 1962’s <cite>Lawrence of Arabia</cite> and 1977’s <cite>Star Wars</cite> have company. With its magnificent vistas of curving sand dunes, two-hundred-miles per hour winds ripping through desert plains, and glowing spice hidden in plain-sight, <cite>Dune</cite> brings Frank Herbert’s world off the page and into our grasp through the eyes of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet).</p>
                </section>
                <figure class="inline-photo">

                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">The spice of Arrakis glows in the air.</figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>For the most part, <cite>Dune</cite> is set on Arrakis, a desert planet rich in spice, the galaxy’s most valuable resource. With some processing, spice grants its users special abilities, including a longer life and the knack to see interstellar routes. The drug is lucrative, turning the chosen rulers of Arrakis, the House of Harkonnen, into brutal oppressors of Arrakis’s native people, the Fremen.</p>

                    <p><cite>Dune</cite> is centered on the family leading House Atreides: Duke Leto (Oscar Issac), Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son, Paul. After banishing the Harkonnens, the Emperor of the Galaxy has commanded them to take ownership of Arrakis. Is it a trap?</p>

                    <p>What is most impressive about <cite>Dune</cite> are the many details that contribute to its fully realized world: the Emperor’s Sardaukar army speak in a menacing language; stillsuits recycle and purify one’s sweat and urine in the desert; ornithopters dash across the sky with real weight and presence; larger-than-life sand worms surf the desert like an ocean; multiple factions fight for control of the galaxy. Han Zimmer’s booming score of drums, a piercing female voice, and invented instruments increase the intensity of the film. There is no discernable difference in the film’s blend of practical photography and computer graphics. It is a testament to the filmmaking skill behind <cite>Dune</cite> that I was lost into this world almost immediately.</p>

                <figure class="inline-photo">

                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">A dragonfly-helicopter hybrid is a durable form of transportation in the desert.</figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>To set up such a world, <cite>Dune</cite>’s opening scenes are very expository in nature, developing the context of Arrakis and its troubled history. Early on in the film, it could have been significantly easier to burden the audience with facts, but screenwriters Eric Roth, Villeneuve, and Jon Spaihts manage a digestible blend of exposition laced with signs of personal drama. Because I have so many unanswered questions (i.e., who is the Emperor), <cite>Dune</cite> knows where to stop with introductions. As the film progresses, the blend shifts away from setup and more towards the stakes.</p>

                    <p>When House Atreides is threatened on Arrakis, first by nature and then by corrupt forces, the film is invigorated with a tension from the dilemma that faces Paul Atreides. Next in line to the throne, Paul is a child stuck in between two worlds, dumbstruck by the dueling paths of his mother and father. Who will this boy become? Is he the Messiah, the savior of Arrakis?</p>

                    <p>The scene that underlines so much of the film is a moment between Paul and his mother in a desert tent that plays like a dream. Set to Han Zimmer’s foreboding track, <cite>Holy War</cite>, and with his family in a moment of crisis, Paul’s visions overwhelm him as chanting whispers stream in from all directions. It is hard to decipher what the voices say, but that is precisely the point. In his mind, all the planets converge towards a single idea: the emperor of the galaxy, Paul Atreides. This is where <cite>Dune</cite> melds the personal drama with the epic tale of worlds colliding. Will the boy accept his fate as a leader? It is Paul’s journey that separates <cite>Dune</cite> from hollow fantasy films. Without it, <cite>Dune</cite> would not be nearly as satisfying.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Still, <cite>Dune</cite> is an incomplete story. Due to the nature of the novel, Paul’s greatest conflicts (and issues yet unknown) are reserved for 2024’s <cite>Dune</cite> Part Two. The promise of a <q>holy war spreading across the universe like an unquenchable fire</q> is not what entices me, it is what Paul fears: <q>a holy war in my name!</q></p>
