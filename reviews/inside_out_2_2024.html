    				<p>After the world was turned on its head by the COVID-19 pandemic, there was one place that many believed was heading to the dustbin: movie theaters. In a joint decision with Disney, PIXAR decided to premiere 3 films on the company’s streaming service: 2020’s <cite>Soul</cite>, 2021’s <cite>Luca</cite>, and 2022’s <cite>Turning Red</cite>.</p>

                    <p>When PIXAR decided to return to the movie theaters with summer 2022’s <cite>Lightyear</cite>, the studio broke all its records - in the wrong direction. A paltry box office, record low attendance, and poor reception made <cite>Lightyear</cite> one of PIXAR’s few blemishes. The next summer, 2023’s <cite>Elemental</cite> premiered in theaters to a meager opening but legged out across the season to earn a very respectable box office gross. After releasing five films back-to-back that did not dominate the cultural conversation, the question remained: Would families and young people return to the theaters in droves for a PIXAR film ever again?</p>

                    <p>The magic of 2015’s <cite>Inside Out</cite> was how it provides a framework for younger audiences to understand the complexity of their feelings – and how it transports older audiences back to their adolescent stage. Nine years ago, I wrote about this phenomenon in aggrandizing terms in <a href="https://www.tanishsmoviereviews.com/reviews/inside_out_2015.html">my review of the first film</a>. With <cite>Inside Out 2</cite>, the point still stands.</p>

                    <p><cite>Inside Out 2</cite> follows the same core band of characters: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Riley, the girl whose emotions we love, is growing up. She is thirteen years old – and the world is becoming more complex. She starts to feel new things: Embarrassment, Boredom, Envy, and Anxiety. Who will dominate Riley’s emotional control center?</p>

                        alt="All of the emotions in Inside Out 2 are staring at a big, pink guy in a hoodie: Embarrassment.">
                </figure>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Before entering the theater, I bought a large popcorn for my parents and me. During check-out, the cashier asked me, <q>What are you seeing today?</q></p>

                    <p>With a smile on my face, I replied, <q><cite>Inside Out 2</cite>.</q></p>

                    <p><q>Ooo, good choice!</q></p>

                    <p>I asked, <q>Have you seen it?</q></p>

                    <p>He responded, <q>I haven’t seen it yet because my daughter wants to see it with me. We are going to see it this weekend. I really hope you enjoy the film!</q></p>

                    <p>That is exactly the sentiment this film produces. As Riley navigates tricky situations in her life, it makes me wonder how I would have reacted at such an age. What would my emotions have done to me? I just know that I would want my family by my side. And the idea of personifying emotions, like Joy, Sadness, and now Anxiety, is a fantastic concept because it serves as a sly introduction to character motivation for kids.</p>

                    <p>A mother once told me that she watched 1977’s <cite>Star Wars</cite> with her six-year-old son, who was the same age that she was when she first saw the film. Her son became obsessed, endlessly spinning on what will happen next and presenting fan theories. However, he would repeatedly ask her, “Mommy, why did Darth Vader do that? Why is he bad?” Her son could not make sense of the idea that someone was naturally “bad.” As we learned two <cite>Star Wars</cite> sequels later, he was on to something! When you apply the same thought process to <cite>Inside Out</cite> and <cite>Inside Out 2</cite>, as those questions about characters naturally arise, the construction of the films also explains core parts of the human experience.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Why is Riley running away?”</blockquote>

                    <p>The emotions – or the lack of emotions – on the console explain Riley’s actions, but what about the emotions themselves?</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Why does Joy not let Sadness touch the memories?”</blockquote>

                    <p>If a kid starts to naturally venture down this path of questioning, they are immersed in a crash course about character development that will serve them the rest of their life. It won’t just benefit them at the movies, or in a book, or listening to a joke. Understanding the answers to these questions will help kids – and even some adults – understand themselves more! That is the highest goal of cinema. It is magical to see.</p>

                    <img

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The film preserves the same structure as <cite>Inside Out</cite>. The sights and sounds are different enough that not many will notice and fewer will care. Voiced by Amy Poehler, who essentially reprises her role as the rapturous Leslie Knope of NBC’s <cite>Parks and Recreation</cite>, Joy is the fulcrum on which the story turns. Like <cite>Inside Out</cite>, Joy shares the spotlight with another character, but to say more about the plot would steal some of the fun.</p>

                    <p>Even with a ninety-minute runtime, <cite>Inside Out 2</cite> packs a refined balance of humor, tension, and catharsis. There is a hilarious reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R706isyDrqI">Apple’s famous Macintosh commercial</a> that aired at the 1984 Super Bowl. (Nice one, PIXAR!) There are bad decisions that we must witness – knowing full well we’ve been there, too. And, at the proper moment, I felt a tear rolling down my cheek. I remember Quentin Tarantino talking about the ending of 2019’s <cite>Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood</cite> saying something like, “If you can laugh, gape, and cry all in one sitting, I’d say that’s a great time at the movies.” Like its mighty predecessor, <cite>Inside Out 2</cite> is a gift for our young moviegoers – a worthy film that can be rediscovered and enjoyed at any age.</p>

                    <p>As Riley continues to grow up, there is a natural proclivity for sequels that follow new experiences and the emotional entanglements that come with them. Given the <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/inside-out-2-shatters-box-office-expectations-biggest-opening-weekend-2024-1236039389/">sequel's spectacular response</a> nine years later, there is a unique opportunity to spread out <cite>Inside Out 3</cite> in a similar way. Wouldn’t it be amazing to see a lineage of films produced over thirty years that engages the children of the day and reminds you of your own childhood? By 2035, many of the kids who enjoyed <cite>Inside Out</cite> would be enjoying <cite>Inside Out 3</cite> with their own children. Disney owns many of the properties that are included in the parent-to-kid cycle, so this would fit the pattern.</p>

                    <p>In ten years, I predict that the next film in the series will follow Riley going to college and falling in love. Will the emotions we know have to band together in different ways to make it work? How will she navigate moving away from home – or balancing ice hockey and school? What new emotions may come into her life?</p>

                    <p>With <cite>Inside Out 2</cite>, PIXAR proved the old saying true once again: When the right film is in the theaters, audiences will come in droves. The four years since the COVID-19 pandemic began has been one of the hardest periods for the company, certainly since it was a start-up rendering 1995’s <cite>Toy Story</cite> on the whale-sized mainframes of the day. After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/business/media/pixar-layoffs-disney.html">a big layoff and two strategic redirections</a>, <cite>Inside Out 2</cite> is a much-needed victory lap for Hollywood’s most creative team. PIXAR is back, baby!</p>
