    				<p>Travis Bickle. As cinematic history unfolds for each generation to the next, his name has brought a multitude of feelings to those who have encountered him - angst, indignation, conflict. Yet, in his better moments, he is charming, persuasive, and admittedly courageous. Is the man depraved or a hero? The answer does not matter as much the question.</p>

                    <p>To state the obvious, there are masters at work here. Paul Schrader envelops us with his characterization of Bickle, Martin Scorsese depicts Bickle with finesse, and Robert DeNiro portrays Bickle with uncompromising effort. </p>

                    <p>Before any dialogue transpires, the opening shots of the film clue us into his character. There’s a comparison between how the outside world disregards Bickle and how Bickle sees the outside world. They see a taxi, but not the man inside. To them, Bickle does not deserve their attention. Not yet. The sweet jazz of Bernard Herrmann’s main theme play over the eyes of Travis Bickle. He sees walking scum. The score is offset with Herrmann’s mix of guitar strings, drums, cymbals, and horns creating suspicion, even a threatening aura.</p>

                    <p>His first encounter with normal society presents the best of Travis Bickle - the best that he knows. He courts Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). One of the reasons his character is so enchanting is that he does not fit expectation. You cannot predict his next words (other than “scum”) or find a pattern in his actions. He is so outwardly unlike others, but his loneliness is so strongly felt. Scorsese gets the audience to genuinely want him to succeed and recover. But, the world he knows is just different from the one we encounter. From our point of view, it may be called violent, dangerous, racist, and vulgar, but from his perspective, it is what it is - no strings attached. When he does his best - that is, going through his life as usual - it is unacceptable to Betsy. The audience does not realize until the end that Betsy is a conduit for us and for society. Ultimately, Travis rejects us.</p>

                    <p>Aside from a large scar on Bickle’s back and a job interview revealing a Marine background, <cite>Taxi Driver</cite> leaves Bickle’s backstory untold. This veil of mystery made me question myself many times asking, “Who is this man?” As Taxi Driver progresses, I reconsidered again and again. He means well, but he is misunderstood, I thought. Travis is forlorn and he cannot escape his mind. He desperately needs a friend, but who? Even Bickle’s only friend, Wizard, a fellow cabbie, admits he does not know what Bickle’s going through. He simply says, <q>I know, I’ve seen a lot of people and... I know.</q> Travis does not have a soul he can whisper to. </p>

                    <p>More than that, Bickle becomes the very thing he detests: <q>I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.</q> When he is rejected by Betsy, the momentum to turn completely inward is set. Schrader and Scorsese’s greatest achievement is allowing the audience to empathize with a character whose sense of ethics is far from our own, especially in moments where his worst instincts appear.</p>

                    <p>During the final shoot-out, Scorsese has the audience’s compass spinning in circles. When Bickle acts on his worst instincts, I questioned my own sense of ethics. How could I have trusted him to do the “right” thing when he was one step away from violence all this time? I empathized with him because his loneliness would be crippling for anyone, but Bickle betrays us. For his sins, he tries to kill himself, but there were no bullets left. Iris (Jodie Foster), the twelve year old he saves, is scarred by the murder of her guardians in front of her. Her parents thank him fervently. Travis is extremely courageous, but he is a racist, a murderer, and somehow celebrated by the very society that rejects what he represents. To all of them, he killed the “right” people. After the night of his murderous rampage, he believes he is rewarded for becoming “a person like other people.” But, he deceives them, too.</p>

                    <p>The ending leaves us right where we began - letting the cycle begin again. Bickle sees the same city with a little less scum. But, now we know who he is and so does he. </p>
