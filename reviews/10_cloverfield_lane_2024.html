    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>2016’s <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> begins with an ominous track titled <cite>Michelle</cite> composed by Bear McCreary. It feels eerie, like what one might hear in HBO’s <cite>The Last of Us</cite>. Something bad is going to happen. As the opening logos subside, director Dan Trachtenberg preserves the minimalism as we see a riverside town with cargo ships moving in opposite directions. Knowing about this film’s connection to 2008's <cite>Cloverfield</cite>, the first shot out of a window made me sit up straight. Is the alien explosion going to hit? Well, it doesn’t.</p>

                    <p>Instead, the camera pans to introduce the main character, Michelle (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead), furiously packing her belongings. McCreary’s track is still going. There is no dialogue, only anxiety. Michelle exits the apartment, leaving behind her keys and a wedding ring. All the shots are close-ups, sometimes handheld, maintaining pressure without focusing on her surroundings. In this quick, yet impactful scene, we understand Michelle’s emotional predicament in an incredibly cinematic way. </p>

                    <p>Michelle drives away from the city during the day into the deep country at night. When she stops for gas at a Kelvin gas station (a J.J. Abrams alien universe staple), a booming vehicle pulls up to the pump next to her. We never see it, but Michelle’s visible tension and its presence in the sound mix tells us everything we need to know.</p>

                    <p>Back on the road, Michelle gets the obligatory phone call from her partner. <q>Come back,</q> he says. She hangs up to listen to the radio: <q>… A catastrophic power surge that has crippled traffic in the area.</q> <em>BOOM</em>! She gets sideswiped and her car plummets through the railing, rolling down a hill. Boy, do the first five minutes set the tone.</p>

                    <p>The film briefly slows its pace, letting me collect my thoughts. Using a jump scare this early in the film was a brave move. 1975’s <cite>Jaws</cite> did not use the jump scare until halfway through the film. Paraphrasing Steven Spielberg: <q>Once you use a jump scare, the audience is always looking for the next one.</q> If tension is the main propulsion of <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite>, then it concerned me that one of its best tools was already used up.</p>

                    <p>Looking back on the experience, the rest of the film was just as fantastic as the opening five minutes. <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> is a tight composition, set almost entirely in an underground bunker with just three characters. To its credit, the film does not put all its chips on a single thread of tension. It juggles between notes of humor, contrition, and grief. Every character has a moment that defines their struggle. When the conflict between characters escalates, it does so sharply, in a way that feels properly motivated. While it becomes a supernatural horror film by the end, it never feels quite so clear in the bunker.</p>

                        alt="The three main character stand around a vat of acid as Howard (John Goodman) warns Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) to not screw around.">
                    <figcaption class="review-text" style="text-align: center;">The two survivors, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) and Michelle (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead) are cornered by Howard (John Goodman) to come clean about their scheming.</figcaption>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>John Goodman is Howard, a conspiracy theorist whose preparations for apocalypse came in handy. For most of the film, Goodman walks a knife’s edge with the role, attracting our sympathies as a divorced father and never repelling us as an outright, crazed maniac. But our doubt always picks at us: Is he telling us the truth? <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> inserts some suspense through specious dialogue. We know when Michelle or Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) are spinning a web of half-truths or lies, but when is Howard doing the same? His words feel more believable than theirs, but there is a darkness hidden beneath his life story.</p>

                    <p>Breaking Spielberg’s axiom, <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> finds a way to insert the second jump scare when a deafening gunshot rattles the room. Launching an insane sequence of events, Howard reveals his true sensibilities by murdering Emmett.  Michelle unleashes Howard’s vat of acid on him, lights it on fire, and escapes using a clever trick that Howard learned in the Navy. What does that say about their relationship?</p>

                    <p>Outside, the world seems normal, but then Michelle sees a gliding spacecraft in the distance. When the bunker explodes, it is drawn near. Michelle’s alien encounter, that serves as the film’s climax, is fun, but is it surprising? The heart of the film feels like the struggle to escape the bunker – and the aliens are the payoff that explain what really happened to the world. However, without the <cite>Cloverfield</cite> association, would aliens being the explanation feel out of place? I don’t think so, but it is hard to know.</p>

                    <p>All I know is that when Michelle destroys the spacecraft, drives away in a getaway car, and makes a left turn to Houston, I wanted the story to keep going. To all involved: Paramount, J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, Dan Trachtenberg, where is the next chapter? The ending of <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> is a wonderful setup, but I am glad to have one masterclass in tension – and how to insert more than one jump scare in a single movie.</p>
