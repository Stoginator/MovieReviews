                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Billy Beane is in an abusive relationship. He has dedicated his life to the American game of baseball, but at forty years old, he is oppressed by it. Within the sport, he has a poor history, with none of the accolades he’d like to own.</p>

                    <p>As the general manager of the Oakland A’s, Billy has a reputation as a hard-ass. With his disdain for small talk, he prefers to get straight to business. When making deals with other teams, he has a keen sense of when he’s being cheated. His colleagues would say that he’s an unemotional guy.</p>

                    <p>Knowing this, it is surprising that the first thing we learn about Billy’s character is how much he cares. When the A’s are eliminated from the 2001 playoffs, Billy is alone in an empty ballpark, sitting in silence. After all that work, you can see the disappointment on his face. Director Bennett Miller uses the next shot to set up the character for us: an extreme close-up of Brad Pitt’s eyes closing. Billy is defeated, fighting back tears. It’s not his first time.</p>

                    <p>When Billy was eighteen, the sports world saw him an athlete with massive potential. He could have been anything: a white-collar worker with a Stanford education, a quarterback in the NFL, or an All-Star baseball player. Billy found himself at a defining fork in the road: play baseball at Stanford on a full scholarship or get drafted in the first round by the New York Mets with a six-figure signing bonus. He chose the Mets for the money.</p>

                    <p>When he joined the Mets, the sports media welcomed him:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>“He’s young. He’s talented. He’s a true five-tool player.”</li>
                            <li>“This guy is a can’t-miss prospect. This is a great, great signing for the New York Mets.”</li>
                            <li>“This could be the turnaround that they’ve been looking for.”</li>
                            <li>“This guy has never failed at anything.”</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>But when he got there, he flamed out. Major League Baseball did not cooperate with him. As he languished in the league, being traded from team to team, they eviscerated him on his way out:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>“There is not an organization in baseball who would not have taken a chance on this young guy. He didn’t pan out. It happens every year. Some do. Some don’t.”</li>
                            <li>“Few scouts can go into the mind of a young man and determine whether he’s really confident about what he can do.”</li>
                            <li>“Many are called. Few are chosen.”</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Imagine what this does to the psyche of a young man, who was raised as a local hero, brimming with self-belief. When he finally arrived at baseball’s greatest stage, he collapsed under the lights. The humiliation burrowed deep.</p>

                    <p>Versions of the same question gnaw at him: “Was I a fluke? A mistake? A lie that I believed?” His rise and fall from grandeur, complete with the media commentary, frame a modern-day tragedy. How do you recover from that? Billy’s internal doubt about his value is the central pillar of the story. It rarely comes out from within, but it is always lurking. This is a titanic role, the stuff of actors’ dreams. We are lucky that Brad Pitt took on the character.</p>

                    <p>After five years in the league, Billy gave up his player career and moved into the Oakland A’s front office. At a crucial juncture on his journey, we hear this decision in a memorable voiceover:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">A’s Staff Member: <q>It’s weird, Billy. You want to give up baseball and become a scout?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Billy: <q>I’m not a baseball player.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">A’s Staff Member: <q>Are you sure this is what you want?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>He ascends the A’s organization from scout to general manager. Now, he faces a different dilemma, which is no less challenging. Billy desperately wants to win, but he is trapped in an unfair game. His job is to assemble a roster that competes with big-market teams like the Boston Red Sox — who have triple the budget. What advantage can he find?</p>

                    <p>Before the 2002 Oakland A’s, baseball was dominated by medieval thinking. Scouts selected their players based on odd characteristics, saying things like:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>“He’s got a classy swing. It’s a real nice stroke.”</li>
                            <li>“When he hits the ball, he drives it. You can hear it all over the ballpark.</li>
                            <li>“He passes the eye candy test.”</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>Baseball scouts believe in their intuition, a gut feeling that tells them this player will make it and that player won’t. But Billy Beane is done with the old-school ways. In a debate with his head scout, he excoriates him:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I’ve sat at those tables and watched you say, ‘I know when I know. And when it comes to your son, I know.’ But you don’t…. You don’t.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>These “time-tested intangibles” are what Billy hates relying on. One day, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) pitches Billy on a new way forward. Brand says,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>It’s all about getting players down to one number…. We’ll find value in players that nobody else can see.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>With Brand's expertise, Billy thinks he has found his advantage: Statistics.</p>

                    <p>In 2002, no baseball teams were primarily using metrics to inform player signings. It was anathema to the way organizations thought. Internally, this approach would set up a fight for the soul of the Oakland A’s.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, no one — not even Billy — knows if this experiment will work. But if he must optimize for wins, there is no better option. Hearing Brand’s pitch, Billy decides to bet the farm, risking his team’s season and his baseball career, while gaining a reputation as the laughing-stock of the league.</p>
                    <p>Going all in, Billy knows that the baseball world will try to derail his plan. Like most people, they hate change. Quickly though, we realize that they are not Billy’s greatest obstacle.</p>

                    <p>No, the most daunting challenge is what lurks in Billy’s mind: His persistent self-doubt. Twenty years later, Billy still hasn’t dealt with the demons of his past. To change the game, he must confront the system that produced his tragic roots. And he must battle the most potent force that lies within.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the film, Billy avoids watching the A’s games. He is so emotionally invested in the outcome that he has to lose steam. Sometimes, he drives in circles in a shipyard, aggressively speeding up only to slam the brakes. On other days, he spends the hours in the gym, sweating it out.</p>

                    <p>If he doesn’t have such an outlet, his temper flares out of control. When things don’t go his way, Billy tosses a chair, flips a table, throws a Gatorade cooler, and destroys a radio. He is emotionally volatile.</p>

                    <p>For years, I have returned to <cite>Moneyball</cite> due to the magnetism of Brad Pitt’s performance. Just like baseball wins come from getting on base, <cite>Moneyball</cite>’s story plays out on Brad Pitt’s face. You can see the stress of his experiment taking its toll. His close-ups and medium-shots speak to the emotional zone of each moment.</p>

                    <p>Is he rolling his eyes or averting his gaze? He is fighting the baseball establishment. Is he squinting with his eyebrows tight? Don’t push him over the edge. Otherwise, he will level you using his vicious way with words. Is he lost in reflection? He is wrestling with his past. The non-verbal ticks are legendary.</p>

                    <p>I also have a limitless love for Billy’s dialogue, written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, two modern masters of Hollywood screenwriting. I suspect Brad Pitt developed a few of these:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>“What are we doing here? Is this the way we do business?”</li>
                            <li>“Whose nephew are you?”</li>
                            <li>“Okay. Okay. My turn.”</li>
                            <li>“This place is a dump.”</li>
                            <li>“That’s what losing sounds like.”</li>
                            <li>“Yeaaaaaah. Cuckoo.”</li>
                            <li>“Every time we meet, I am reinvigorated by my love of the game.”</li>
                            <li>“Get her a bowling ball for all I care.”</li>
                            <li>“Pete. You’re a good egg. I’ll call ya.”</li>
                            <li>“Do we believe in this thing or not?”</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>I could go on. It is stellar, delivered to perfection, and ingrained in my memory.</p>

                    <p>More importantly, what endears us to Billy Beane — and commits us to seeing his journey through for better or worse — is his persistence. This is a man whose fortitude will be stress tested in the most dramatic fashion. He refuses to alter his course.</p>

                    <p>The actors around Pitt portray a subplot of workplace drama. The scouts and the clubhouse manager, Art Howe (the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman), showcase the difficulty of organizational alignment. Collaboration becomes difficult when leaders have fundamental disagreements. Billy tells Art,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>It doesn’t matter what moves I make if you don’t play the team the way they’re designed to be played.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>In response, Art says,</p>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Billy… you’re out of your depth.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>This kind of organizational misalignment is rarely seen in movies but is abundant in real life. <cite>Moneyball</cite> has it in spades. Billy has to navigate it.</p>

                    <p>Pitt’s performance is elevated by technical decisions made behind the camera. For every shot of Pitt sitting, staring, or reflecting, editor Christopher Tellefsen lets them run as long as he could. They are so interesting because we can see a man wrestling with his demons, trying to make it out of the abyss of his past. No one can save him except himself. All we can do is watch.</p>

                    <p>The sound mix is equally meritorious. It is inconspicuous and effective at elevating the emotion of the moment. Take the opening scene: a montage of a playoff baseball game. The stakes are high. Michael Danna’s track, One Out Away, coincides with feet stamping in a stadium, bats connecting with pitches, a rapturous crowd, and announcers’ commentary.</p>

                    <p>As the perspective shifts back to Oakland, the sound shifts to a television set. Then, it goes to an empty clubhouse and a ballpark with one man in the stands. The only sound is the white noise of the hallways and the shipyards in the distance outside. The mix carries us through the adrenaline rush of the game to the emptiness of losing. In other moments, the sound fades out to take us into Billy’s perspective.</p>

                    <p>On a technical level, the film is hell-bent on using every tool to put the story front and center. It is masterful work from all involved. We never get sidetracked from Billy’s quest:</p>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Any other team wins the World Series, good for them. They’re drinking champagne, they get a ring. But if we win, on our budget, with this team… we’ll have changed the game.</q></blockquote>

                    <p><cite>Moneyball</cite> has become a classic docu-drama. While it departs from the historical record for the sake of entertainment, it belongs to the pantheon of great films based on true stories. It captures Brad Pitt’s greatest performance (so far). It is internally consistent, fully formed in its depiction of character, and a prime example of technical excellence — where the camera and sound serve only the story.</p>

                    <p>Now, I see why Bennett Miller hasn’t made another feature film in eleven years. Because making a film like <cite>Moneyball</cite> is pretty damn hard.</p>
