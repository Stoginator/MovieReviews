    				<p>Early in <cite>The Creator</cite>, the protagonist, Joshua (John David Washington), cuts the power cable of a clearly conscious robot. His partner screams in terror as he tries to comfort her. He tells her, “It’s just programming!” We do not pause for even a moment to consider his actions; in fact, cutting the cable is what we expected since we have seen this moment many times. It is Joshua’s partner whose reaction surprises us.</p>

                    <p>From the perspective of a budding computer scientist, <cite>The Creator</cite> is rooted around one central idea: speciesism. You will find thousands of articles, statistics, and op-eds about racism, sexism, and agism, but speciesism lives in comparatively rarified air. It is the belief that one species has primacy over all others. In this case, that humans are inherently more valuable than machines. Not all the characters we meet share our ideas. I cannot forget the haunting words of a simple farmer yelling at a relentlessly violent soldier on her land trying to destroy artificial intelligence: “It’s evolution!”</p>

                    <p>By selectively showing us human history beginning in present-day Earth, <cite>The Creator</cite> embraces this idea. Humanoids enter our society and assist our loved ones. As they become more sophisticated, they cook food, clean up after us, and eventually fill our police forces. One fateful day, a nuclear warhead obliterates Los Angeles and the attack is blamed on AI. Fearing extinction, the United States launches a ban on AI, while New Asia continues development – a balkanized reality that starts a war. Our natural sympathies are to contain the threat of AI from realizing even more terrible powers.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Stylistically, <cite>The Creator</cite> sometimes misses the mark for me. For example, Radiohead’s <cite>Everything In Its Right Place</cite> plays during a military operation. I loved hearing it in an IMAX auditorium; it was cool. But, that feeling evolved into head-scratching as I wondered what was its place in the scene? It felt like a very specific vision of the director, but couldn’t the film’s legendary composer, Hans Zimmer, have pulled off something more unique? (If you are interested to know, listen to <cite>Standby</cite> on the film’s original score.)</p>

                    <p>Moreover, many dramatic elements of the movie do not land right. Take the introduction to Joshua and Maya (Gemma Chan). Within five minutes of meeting them, their relationship escalates from infatuated married couple to betrayal; it merely works on an expositional level, not an emotional one. We can barely keep up! Take another scene with Harun (Ken Watanbe), a Japanese humanoid protecting other machines from the U.S. Army. In a throwaway line, Harun coldly tells Joshua that the United States blamed machines for the nuclear attack on Los Angeles when it was caused by a human programming error. It was removing the foundation for the U.S. government – and the audience’s – deadly pursuit against AI. This was a new piece of knowledge revealed without the seismic shift that should have been felt.</p>

                    <p>Some events felt like retreading been-there, seen-that material. <cite>The Creator</cite> is essentially a father-daughter journey, much inspired by <cite>The Last of Us</cite>, while being chased by the robot police and the U.S. government. There is a large battle scene with tanks that distinctly reminded me of 2009’s <cite>Avatar</cite>. Even the NOMAD, a massive, war station orbiting Earth, is basically this world’s version of the Death Star. I could see inspiration from Bungie’s video game series, <cite>Destiny</cite>, in the robot and weapon designs.</p>

                    <p>The uneven polish on <cite>The Creator</cite> never overwhelmed the experience. The philosophical, political, and technological ideas being explored as a fully realized story are compelling. John David Washington and Madeleine Voyles carry the emotional ideas in the film to their conclusion. The film is a beautiful composition of live-action photography and visual effects, filmed in ultrawide 2.76:1 – a modern rarity.</p>

                    <p>With a movie this bold, small fumbles are simply “Tough shit.” I came to see the story, but I stayed to see the big ideas that the story expressed. It is rare enough for Hollywood to fund someone’s unadulterated, creative vision with a budget big enough for the material. When it happens, it is a gift.</p>

                    <p>Although, one week after opening worldwide, <cite>The Creator</cite> has only made $37 million dollars. It is quite a shame that such a grand vision is not receiving the reception it deserves. This film should spark a conversation about what kind of future we want. It begins in a dystopia, a world where we are afraid of a superintelligence gone rogue. Slowly, <cite>The Creator</cite> turns into another kind of vision where we and sentient machines peacefully coexist.</p>

                    <p>This turning of expectations – from our initial indifference to a robot losing its head to our heartache when a humanoid child expresses her sadness – is the film’s greatest achievement. In the realm of cinematic storytelling, <cite>The Creator</cite> expresses what has only been theory, imagining a potential future in an emotional way. A world where humanoid mothers care for human sons and a human father cares for his humanoid daughter.</p>
    			
                    <p>To paraphrase Max Tegmark, the author of <cite>Life 3.0</cite>, a fascinating book about the possibilities in a world with AI: life is about information processing, adaptation, and evolution. Anything that follows these patterns, whether it is carbon-based (i.e., us) or made from silicon (i.e., artificial general intelligence), must be considered life.</p>

                    <p>Who imagined a future where humans sacrifice themselves to free machines from bondage? A future where machines have an equal right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? What would you say to a humanoid child who asks you, “Am I going to Heaven?”</p>

                    <p><cite>The Creator</cite> is about machines’ march towards freedom. As the U.S. military becomes hellbent on destroying machines, we become more accepting of them. Somehow, regardless of the programming and the metal underneath, we begin to see ourselves. Director Gareth Edwards has imagined a radical world where machines and humans are equal. The final shot of the film – a beaming Alphie and a cut to black – is the director guiding us to the emotional expression of this idea. This film did not make a big splash, but it has time on its side. It is a visionary showing us one of many futures that we might have.</p>

                    <p><em>P.S.</em> Many of the ideas explored in The Creator have a theoretical background. My connection to these ideas began in Max Tegmark’s 2017 book, <cite><a href="https://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9781101970317">Life 3.0</a></cite>. If imagining different versions of humanity’s future with AI interests you, I encourage you to buy a copy or rent it at your public library (as I did)!</p>
