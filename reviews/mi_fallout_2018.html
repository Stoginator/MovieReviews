    				<p>If there’s one thing people all over the world know Hollywood for, it’s action movies. And that is without a doubt the trademark of Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise. This actor-director combo have made some good action movies, and <cite>Mission Impossible: Fallout</cite> is the best of the bunch.</p>

                    <p>Let’s be honest. Recounting the plot here is a waste of everybody’s time. Just watch the film and find out. It has so many twists and turns that literally everything you thought you knew isn’t what it seems. You know the characters (save a few newcomers featuring the excellent Henry Cavill aka Superman).</p>

                    <p>The first difference is the tone of this film compared to the previous entries. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is presented with a difficult question in the beginning of the film. And it pulls into the mix the gray areas which exists in some of the best movies. Decisions are tough, questions have difficult answers, and the consequences of every action come back. This is why <cite>Fallout</cite> succeeds on a higher level than the other <cite>Mission</cite> films.</p>

                    <p>The opening sequences in Paris were absolutely gut-wrenching. There’s a skydiving scene that had me lurching forward in my seat. There’s a bathroom fight scene I am convinced will be remembered in movie history. It feels real and painful as I would think knocking someone out does feel. I winced more than I should have. There’s no doubt that this is a considerably darker movie comparatively. And that’s a testament to the strength and power of this film as that was only the beginning.</p>

                    <p>McQuarrie and Cruise have shot many car chase scenes together across three films. To be honest, I have lost count of how many were in this film, but everytime Ethan Hunt stepped into a car, it looked damn impressive ... and easy to follow. Ethan’s mission takes him across multiple cities and a key part of why the action is so engrossing is because it is captured in camera. It’s very safe to say that the McQuarrie-Cruise duo have mastered the action genre. </p>

                    <p>The stunts are terrifying (as Tom Cruise found a way to top climbing the Burj Khalifa), the tension is overwhelming, the stakes are real, and the action never stops. No wonder this is the best <cite>Mission Impossible</cite> yet - and that’s saying a lot!</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>The sequel - the first of two parts - was released today. In anticipation, I rewatched <cite>Fallout</cite> and found that my original writeup remains genuine. After listening to the commentary by Cruise and McQuarrie during a long car trip, I have a few additions.</p>

                    <p>The preparation required for these stunts takes hundred of hours of time - and sometimes years. The stunts are insanely dangerous and unlikely to ever be attempted again by a leading actor in a two hundred million dollar production - other than Tom Cruise. Cruise drives handmade BMWs (car and motorcycle), drifts, speeds, flies a helicopter, jumps out a military plane at 25,000 feet, and runs across London's rooftops. Ethan Hunt only does those things once in the movie, but Cruise does as many takes as needed to "get the shot." At this rate, Cruise is carving out a place in movie history that is solely and utterly his. A dramatic actor turned stuntman who does both better than anyone else.</p>

                    <p>In addition, I would like to commend Lorne Balfe who crafted a score that is unlike any other in the series. Bongos, piano, and big horns! Every setpiece has its own musical texture. The HALO jump gets <cite>Free Fall</Cite>, breaking out Solomon Lane gets <cite>The Exchange</cite>, the motorcycle chase gets <cite>Escape Through Paris</cite>, the London footchase gets <cite>Stairs and Rooftops</cite>, and the helicopter duel gets <cite>Scalpel and Hammer</cite>. <cite>Your Mission</cite> raises the stakes in introducing John Lark. There is a heartbreaking orchestral composition in <cite>Should You Choose to Accept...</cite> Even the original <cite>Mission</cite> by Lalo Schifrin is adapted with bongos and a choir as <cite>Mission: Accomplished</cite> - making for the most entertaining main theme in the series! It is a fantastic collection of lovingly made music and the most spectacular action film music since 2010's <cite>Inception</cite>.</p>

                    <p>The only duo in the world who could make a film this layered in character as well as setpieces are Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie. Each film since 2011's <cite>Ghost Protocol</cite> demonstrates a greater mastery of the action genre, while staying true to <cite>Mission</cite> by expanding upon the established themes of the series. From all I have seen in modern action movies, <cite>Fallout</cite> has no competition. It is the greatest action film I have ever seen. As always, masters are never satisfied. They always believe they can do better. The upcoming <cite>Mission</cite> films will teach us how great action, high stakes, and character can be composed into great cinematic experiences. <cite>Fallout</cite> seems like just the beginning.</p>
