    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>I first saw <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> when I was fifteen. In my memory, it was the “boring” film in the trilogy. Back then, I was looking for different things in movies: more boom-boom, less dialogue, more pace. In one of the special features, <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=e77hX70LrA0">From Identity to Supremacy</a>, Matt Damon explains the production team’s goal with <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite>: <q>Our hope was to build a movie that the action was integrated into, so that you invest in the characters and you really believe that their problems are problems that you might have. These kind of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.</q> Not only did they hit their own benchmark, they changed actions movies for good.</p>

                    <p>From the first shot of Jason Bourne floating in the sea, the hook is in. Who is this guy? The influence of Bourne’s silhouette is profound, finding imitators like 2013’s <cite><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVu3gS7iJu4&pp=ygUUbWFuIG9mIHN0ZWVsIHRyYWlsZXI%3D">Man of Steel</a></cite>. John Powell’s epic score combining strings and percussion into a pulse-pounding listen are ubiquitous as temp music, the tracks that film editors sometimes use when putting material together. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/IEfQ_9DIItI?si=vmn8NMaTv6iA101C&t=88">listen to a track</a> in 2006’s <cite>Battlestar Galactica</cite> that sounds suspiciously like <cite>Bourne on Land</cite>. How about the scene where a weapon-less Bourne improvises during a fist fight and uses a pen? (Not an exploding pen, of course.) This character is so intelligent that we are racing to keep up with him! How will he escape the authorities trying to catch him at an American embassy? He finds a way to shimmy and climb down fifty-feet in an unfathomable way. After he did it, I sat there wondering, <q>Wow. It seems obvious now, doesn’t it?</q> Every problem does.</p>

                    <p>Bourne keeps surprising us. As a character, he is effectively the inverse of James Bond. He does not use gadgets, seek women, or look for trouble. His past is his bane. There are no fancy Aston Martins, just a more-affordable Mini Cooper. <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> is a rare action film where the narrative propulsion is found in character, not violence. The main attraction is a blossoming love between two people thrown into chaos. These two characters, Jason and Marie (Franka Potente), are extremely empathetic. We are with them. Their chemistry means the explosions take second-billing, but that is a gift. The team behind Bourne knows that explosions and car chases have their novelty. Use them scarcely, otherwise they become repetitive. An audience can only see so many before dullness sets in.</p>

                    <p>So many years and action films later, rewatching <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> was refreshingly fun. The action is motivated by a simple question: Who am I? Because of that, the action feels natural, a way for the characters to take the smallest possible step to achieve their goal. All that gunfire serves a purpose, to threaten the characters, to create more chaos, and to keep us on the edge of our seat. Opposing the main characters, Conklin (Chris Cooper) and Abbott (Brian Cox) remain comfortably in Langley, Virginia, causing chaos thousands of miles away across Europe. The picture that <cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> paints of government bureaucracy is very unflattering: when covering up one’s mistakes, there are no red lines. The C.I.A. is so bloated and compartmentalized that no one at the top knows what is happening down below. Assassinations are attempted and cleaned up. Today, this message might resonate more than it probably did in 2002.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Bourne Identity</cite> closes its story compellingly. The question plaguing Jason is finally resolved and loose ends are tied up. The movie feels complete. A viewer would have no idea that a sequel was produced - and, during filming, neither did the production team. This tradition of going all out on one movie at a time is rare: think Lucas’s original <cite>Star Wars</cite>, Coppola’s <cite>The Godfather</cite>, Zemeckis’s <cite>Back to the Future</cite>, Linklater’s <cite>Before Sunrise</cite>, and Nolan’s <cite>Batman Begins</cite>. In each trilogy, the first film was a gamble that became enough of a success to warrant a sequel. However, each filmmaker took the same philosophy of artistic risk and went all out on the sequel. Luckily, that is just what happened with the character of Jason Bourne.</p>
