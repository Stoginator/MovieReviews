    				<p>PIXAR Studios, responsible for the <cite>Toy Story</cite> Trilogy, <cite>Up</cite>, <cite>The Incredibles</cite>, and <cite>Ratatouille</cite>, has forged another classic: <cite>Inside Out</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Taking place inside of a 12 year old girl's mind, the main emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger all control how she, Riley, feels. Everything Riley is, her personality, her quirkiness, her playfulness, is connected to 5 core memories. But when these memories spur out of hand, Riley's emotions need to take control.</p>

                    <p>Again, PIXAR, or you could say the director and writer, Pete Doctor, has been able to successfully create a very original, very inventive, and very comedic idea and bring it to the screen. This movie had me laughing quite often and had me on my butt once or twice, and to be completely honest, no movie has ever been made like this ever before.</p>

                    <p>No movie has asked you to delve into yourself and find your inner calling more than Inside Out. I hope I really have a Joy, a Fear, a Sadness, a Disgust, and let's not forget, an Anger. Also, these characters prove to be the main focus of the movie and you see the repercussions of their actions on Riley. Each one has a unique personality (they're emotions!) and the writing and animation capitalize on it.</p>

                    <p>Voiced by Amy Poehler of <cite>Parks and Recreation</cite>, Joy is the ringleader of the other emotions. Phyllis Smith voices Sadness, an emotion that represents the melancholy side of everyone. In a hilarious role (as usual), Bill Hader voices Fear, who nitpicks at every single situation and aspect of every place to discover what Riley should be afraid of. Taking more of a side role, Disgust, voiced by <cite>The Office</cite> star Mindy Kaling, is smart and more sophisticated than most would think (remember that!). Lastly, Lewis Black takes on the part of Anger, who mostly embodies the part of ourselves most of us don't want to go to.</p>

                    <p>Most of all, this picture is very easy to relate to. Parents and kids will connect to the experiences Riley and her parents have on screen. Even so, the plot of <cite>Inside Out</cite> is outstanding and some of the best material PIXAR has ever had. Some could even make the argument of it being ingenious which I would very loyally support because PIXAR has again showcased a movie with appeal to all audiences.</p>

                    <p>In the end, this "feels" more of a PIXAR movie than anything else has. Boasting a very comedic and eventful script, beautifully written and voiced characters, and colorful, attenuated animation to look at, <cite>Inside Out</cite> could be the animated marvel that only comes once a decade.</p>
