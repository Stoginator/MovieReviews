    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Writer-director Sean Baker is a treasure within the American filmmaking community. Throughout a twenty-five year career, he has only worked on independent (“indie”) films, eschewing the creative control that Hollywood studios can demand. Cobbling together funding from different places every time he makes a film, he tells stories about people in America that no studio would green-light. But make no mistake: They are essential stories about our nation.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>Anora</cite>, Baker focuses his narrative on a young girl from Brooklyn, an escort of only twenty-three years old. Ani (Mikey Madison) is good at what she does, enticing much older men who are reluctant to engage her services. She works the 9pm to 5am shift.</p>

                    <p>Ani doesn’t own a car or a home. She lives with a roommate she doesn’t like, in a dead-end job with no healthcare or 401K. She’s stuck, living in the shadows of our society. Life sucks.</p>

                    <p>We have no idea how she got here; even if she wanted out, putting “escort” on her resumé wouldn’t get her far. It’s also impossible to plan for the future when your <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm">Circadian rhythm</a> is so jacked up.</p>

                    <p>One night, Ani meets a fellow, young traveller: a Russian kid with a goofy demeanor named Vanya. She performs her services - and meets him again the next day at his home. Vanya is only twenty-one, yet he lives in a mansion, with a great view, and has an unlimited supply of cash. Lucky kid.</p>

                    <p>In Ani’s mind, Vanya starts to become more than a client. She hides her feelings for him, but they are obvious. For us, it is unclear what attracts Ani: him or his enormous spending muscle? Vanya splurges on extravagant parties, private planes, penthouse hotel suites, and designer clothes. Eventually, we think, this joy ride will end.</p>

                    <p>Staying true to his character, Vanya ups the ante. He proposes to Ani in Las Vegas. In the scene, Sean Baker, who also edits all of his films, holds the shot of Ani because the actress, Mikey Madison, plays it so well. She documents the wave of emotions that Ani experiences, hinting at bad experiences using only her face and tone. Her initial reluctance is buoyed by anger underneath - at all the men who made promises they never kept. When Vanya reiterates his marriage proposal, we see her lean in. This is the moment where Ani and the audience begin to accept the dream - that a poor girl in Brooklyn could marry into wealth and change the trajectory of her life. The elation during the wedding sequence is emotionally essential to the film.</p>

                    <p>To make <cite>Anora</cite> accessible for a wide, adult audience, Baker exploits our familiarity of genre conventions. The first third is a romantic comedy where boy meets girl. The second third features an extended dialogue sequence with dashes of physical comedy all in the same room, which feels like something in a Quentin Tarentino film. Somehow, Baker manages to fit in the tension of a chase movie. We never know what’s going to happen. To paraphrase Tarentino, <q>When you don’t know whether to laugh or let your jaw drop, that’s a great time at the movies!</q></p>

                    <p>The final third of <cite>Anora</cite> is the disillusionment of Ani and ourselves. When the film began, we were skeptical that Ani could become the wealthy spouse of a Russian oligarch’s son. We started to take on her emotions. As she believed in the dream, so did we. As she tried to fight for it, so did we. Baker and Madison condition us to hope.</p>

                    <p>Coincidently on the morning before I saw <cite>Anora</cite>, I stumbled across an article in the Wall Street Journal titled “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-economy-strength-rich-spending-2c34a571">The U.S. Economy Depends More Than Ever on Rich People.</a>” Ten percent of the country spends fifty percent of the money. This means that wealthiest people are amassing more assets like cars, houses, and stocks, while the bottom ninety percent are barely keeping up their spending with inflation. This is an important piece of context, providing an access point into why <cite>Anora</cite> rings true.</p>

                    <p>If you know where to look, this dichotomy of experience is built into <cite>Anora</cite>. The richest characters use the latest iPhone Pros with the three-camera array. Everyone else has decade-old smartphones. Of the Russian family’s fixers in America, the lowest-level guy (Yura Borisov) drives an old truck. His boss and the Russian family exclusively sit in decked-out Cadillac Escalades. Working people like Ani and her colleagues celebrate their birthdays on-the-job, while the rich use a birthday as one more reason to spend lavishly. When you experience the rich life, how do you go back?</p>
                    
                    <p>That is the dream that traps Ani. When Vanya enters her life, she feels like she hit the lotto jackpot, waving goodbye to her colleagues at the nightclub in a gesture that screams <q>I made it!</q> Ani doesn’t want to accept any possibility that her situation might fall apart.</p>
                    
                    <p>And as <cite>Anora</cite> rolls on, neither do we. This is Sean Baker’s greatest trick. Using Ani, he lures us into believing in the possibility of her marriage surviving. We are desperate to see Ani make it out of the system. We want the Hollywood ending.</p>
                    
                    <p>Like a sledgehammer to the face, the final third of <cite>Anora</cite> hurts so much because we were lured in by hope. We want Ani to escape from the system. From a family this wealthy, even some starter money would be enough to change her destiny. For breaking her heart, the Russian family, who could spend a million dollars in a few hours, leave her with a ten thousand dollar check. Vanya pays forward a tone-deaf, final comment:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“Thank you for making my trip to America so fun.”</blockquote>

                    <p><em>That</em> is the most insulting gesture of all. In a few words, it shows us that Vanya does not understand Ani. His week-long marriage will be a funny story. But for Ani, it forces her to question her entire identity. Am I just an accessory that people pay to use and discard at their convenience? Vanya has no idea what kind of emotion he is messing with.</p>

                    <p>These are the moments where the fictitious nature of <cite>Anora</cite> often slips away. The ending is a slow burn, as it should be. After Ani's fast ascent to the highest reaches of the American Dream, we have to sit with her descent all the way back to square one. We must confront her new reality.</p>

                    <p>Ani is stuck in a place where she has no social mobility. She’s only twenty-three but we know in our bones that she has nowhere to go. By her reactions, we gather that, during her entire life, she’s been surrounded by people who aren’t protectors, but parasites. Now, she’s broken by a dream that will never come true - and questioning her self-worth.</p>

                    <p>In the final shot of <cite>Anora</cite>, Sean Baker uses one, long take to show Ani processing the whiplash she feels. Ani attempts a return to what feels familiar, an arena where she is dominant, but she gives up mid-way, succumbing to the utter devastation in her heart. When she breaks down in tears, it’s not just because she lost her grip on the dream. In that moment, she is asking the world: <em>Will I ever be loved?</em></p>
