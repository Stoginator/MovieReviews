    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>2023 has not been a fabulous year for franchises. The fifth <cite>Indiana Jones</cite> landed with a loud clunk! <cite>Mission Impossible</cite> ended its theatrical box office run below expectations. Most of the year’s superhero films have made considerably less than their predecessors. An old fallacy that I imagine the Hollywood suits love to say is <q>Past success connotes future success.</q> However, the general lesson of this year in franchise movies has been past success signals no guarantees. Audiences easily recognize hollow characters, unengaging stories, and a lack of a good reason to even exist. Would <cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> follow the crowd or turn the tables?</p>

                    <p><cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> is a two-front film featuring a plot dealing with the famed monster and an emotional story about Japanese citizens trying to live again in the post-war era after 1945. Luckily for us, the characters in this film can be in their own compelling movie. On the other hand, could Godzilla be all alone in his? Not nearly as effectively.</p>

                    <p>The movie gets us in the seat by promoting the monster, but we stay because of these characters. <cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> is about the synthesis of characters – both human and monster. The film’s writer-director, Takashi Yamazaki, has learned the right lessons from years of forgettable, uninvolving franchise films. This is a character drama … in a Godzilla movie!</p>

                    <p>When the lights dimmed in my IMAX theater, the number one question I had was, “How long before Godzilla shows up?” Will the director make us wait an hour to see him? Far from it. Given the focus on character, Godzilla’s presence operates on a higher thematic level - becoming a tool of trauma for the main character, Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), and threatening the audience with a sense of dread.</p>

                    <p>Propped up by a wonderful cast of Japanese actors, their characters bring emotional heft to the table. What defined the society of post-war Japan? It is a tale of anguish, dishonor, broken families, and lost generations. Noriko (Minami Hamabe) is a young woman, caring for a baby that is not hers. There are few employment opportunities. Towns are demolished, with parents and children lost in the rubble. As we grow to care for the plight of our main characters, we are confronted with a terrifying question: what do the Japanese people do when Godzilla infiltrates their already fractured society? There are times when the ambitious script strays too far into melodrama, but those events are forgivable and do not linger. <cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> gets much more very right than wrong.</p>

                    <p>Particularly, I was struck by one memorable sequence bolstered by the convergence of character, spectacle, and surprise. Eventually, Godzilla makes his way to the city of Ginza on the Japanese mainland, crunching civilians, leveling buildings, and roaring at deafening levels. What I witnessed was truly jaw-dropping in its degree of destruction – and the manner in which it happens. How does the visual effect work look so convincing?</p>

                    <p>With such a limited budget for a movie that feels very large, <cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> should be an inspiration to cash-strapped filmmakers. For filmgoers, it is an example of the power of cinematic fundamentals. With its strong focus on character and a great sense of scale to the VFX work, I would bet that few sensed the film’s unusually small budget!</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the only gripe I have with the movie was the incredibly loud sound mix. My seat shook. My ears rang. I recognize my own complicity in attending an IMAX showing. However, some of Godzilla’s sound effects seemed one-note. After the first encounter with Godzilla, the footsteps, the roar, and the heat ray made me want to cover my ears. I was not catching any details or differences between the occurrences of Godzilla’s features, only the sheer loudness. That may have been the intent, but eventually I was exhausted by the extremes of the mix: near-silence during conversations and earsplitting noise during scenes featuring Godzilla.</p>

                    <p><cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> also displays its cinematic inspirations proudly. The pilot, Shikishima, has a shaking hand that closely resembles Tom Hanks as Captain Miller in 1998’s <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite>. When the character flies his plane, the camera angle in the cockpit instantly reminded me of Tom Hardy as Farrier in 2017’s <cite>Dunkirk</cite>, a film whose influence seemed most prominent. I heard similar music to Variation-15, played during <cite>Dunkirk</cite>’s spectacular denouement. A scene with a mass of civilian ships is obviously derived from the same source. Notably, Shikishima seems to ride the same motorbike with the same goggles as Peter O’Toole’s portrayal of T.E. Lawrence in 1962’s <cite>Lawrence of Arabia</cite>. There are likely many that I missed.</p>

                    <p>In a world where franchise films could be better, <cite>Godzilla Minus One</cite> steps up to the plate – taking a big swing that hits the sweet spot where characters make the spectacle meaningful.</p>
