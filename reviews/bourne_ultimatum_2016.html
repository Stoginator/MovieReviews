    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>The Bourne Ultimatum</cite> is the finale of the trilogy and director Paul Greengrass masterfully uses that to his advantage. If any series makes its way to a finale, the audiences are going be in a different state - alerted. <cite>Ultimatum</cite>  is a two hour chase - Jason Bourne style. That means more cars, fist fights, and most of all - tension. To be able to sustain an audience through two hours of raw tension requires a mastery of filmmaking, and Mr. Greengrass exemplifies that.</p>

                    <p>That's not to say that Bourne doesn't relax a bit. Dialogue is once again prioritized as Bourne's most revolutionary ally. Mixing in dialogue with action, story, and sometimes comedy all moving into a single package is utterly difficult, but Greengrass along with the writers and editor - Christopher Rouse - accomplish such a feat. The fact is every scene demands your attention for the thrill and curiosity we have about Bourne. That I walked away elated, not exhausted, was a testament to the power of good filmmaking that invests in characters while delivering some of the cinema's best action.</p>

                    <p><cite>Ultimatum</cite> follows Bourne on his "last" mission to try to circumvent around the Central Intelligence Agency in joint with the National Security Agency. We follow Bourne uncovering the last clues while it seems against all odds as the CIA do everything in their power to outsmart him.</p>

                    <p>The answers to Jason Bourne's history with the CIA are discovered. Damon develops the character to his utmost potential. The climax is raw and powerful and in complete contrast to his beginnings, and, as the the film depicts, the CIA. In irony is a shot of the American flag on the CIA director's desk as he acknowledges Jason Bourne. The only major supporting character introduced in Ultimatum, Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn is crucial to everyone in the story. Straithairn allows his character to boil until he explodes - powerfully in his expedition mounted on Bourne.</p>

                    <p>All said, Ultimatum is a great action movie - one of the best ever with Identity and Supremacy. To say the finale was merely satisfying is an understatement, it was exhilarating.</p>
