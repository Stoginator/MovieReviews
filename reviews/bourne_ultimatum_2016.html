                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>In the eighth grade, my English class learned about two literary devices: mood (the reader’s feeling) and tone (the author’s feeling). Our teacher decided to teach us this through the movies. One of the films she chose was 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum, specifically the scene where Jason Bourne runs on the rooftops of Tangier, Morocco chasing an assassin. I had heard of this film, but had never experienced such a combination of elements: John Powell’s excellent music, the quick cuts, the always-moving camera, and Matt Damon. Man, was I excited! It was a new, fresh style of filmmaking that invaded my consciousness.</p>

                    <p>Now, consider me lucky to have seen the entire trilogy twice! That eighth grader would be mightily impressed. Housed within the action movie genre, each of the Bourne films adds its own specific touch to the expected proceedings. 2002’s The Bourne Identity is a love story. 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy is about Jason’s search for redemption. The Bourne Ultimatum is the finale, testing Jason’s resolve to see how far he will go to end the C.I.A. program that creates ruthless killers.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne."</blockquote>

                    <p>Director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood return, forging a relentless pace through the camera and showing us Jason Bourne’s calculations in real-time. The style worked so well in The Bourne Supremacy, but here it is even more refined. With a variety of shots to select, editor Christopher Rouse has constructed a film where there is always a focus. No cut is frivolous. Shots do not linger on screen unless Bourne lingers on something. Bourne literally sets the pace. That can be seen in the runtime: none of the Bourne films cross two hours, which has become a standard for most action films.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Do you even know why you're supposed to kill me? Look at us. Look at what they make you give.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The script by Tony Gilroy is sharp and concise, pinning two C.I.A. bureaucrats against each other again. Joan Allen’s character, Pamela Landy, returns in a head-to-head with David Strathairn’s Noah Vosen. While I did not agree with his actions, I really enjoyed seeing Strathairn’s play Vosen, a selfish, no-holds-barred gladiator. Halfway through the movie, in a scene where Vosen speaks to the C.I.A. director, there is an image of an American flag on the director’s desk as they openly speak about betraying Landy and blatantly breaking the law. These guys never learn, do they?</p>

                    <p>At times, The Bourne Ultimatum felt like a retread of the first two films in different locales. There are only so many variations of foot and car chases. The Tangier foot chase, that I saw in the eighth grade, is the absolute, stand-out set piece. In the special features, producer Frank Marshall explains that the crew filmed in Tangier during Ramadan, where Muslims do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset. As a gesture of respect, the entire crew adhered to the tradition – and managed to do their best work. The scene represents the ultimate peak of what makes the Bourne films such a strong entry in the action genre: a sense of purpose, scoring-to-picture, camerawork as a viewpoint into each character’s perspective during a high-stakes chase, editing as a setter of pace, and … Matt Damon.</p>

                    <p>What gave the action purpose was finality. Using all his skills, this is where Jason Bourne would redeem himself for his original sin and rid himself of the moniker once-and-for-all. Outside of the corrupt and morally bankrupt world of government espionage, we hope he finds his humanity again. He made the choice that Marie told him he had.</p>

                    <p>Like many intellectual properties at the movies, The Bourne Ultimatum was followed up by lesser efforts: 2012’s The Bourne Legacy and 2016’s Jason Bourne. Even with some heavy-hitting actors and crew, The Bourne Legacy resurrects Treadstone under a new name with a new agent – and does not go anywhere in over two hours. Jason Bourne tries to expand on Jason’s backstory before he entered Treadstone, but always felt like it was grasping at straws. Neither film was able to look into the mirror to see that Bourne’s story is complete. Without a fresh take on the same story, their box office performance and reception are a lesson in overfishing the same material.</p>

                    <p>As for me, I pretend that Bourne’s story ends as poetically as it began. Bourne is assumed dead in the water, but he survives. This time however, he knows exactly who he is and so do we.</p>

    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>The Bourne Ultimatum</cite> is the finale of the trilogy and director Paul Greengrass masterfully uses that to his advantage. If any series makes its way to a finale, the audiences are going be in a different state - alerted. <cite>Ultimatum</cite>  is a two hour chase - Jason Bourne style. That means more cars, fist fights, and most of all - tension. To be able to sustain an audience through two hours of raw tension requires a mastery of filmmaking, and Mr. Greengrass exemplifies that.</p>

                    <p>That's not to say that Bourne doesn't relax a bit. Dialogue is once again prioritized as Bourne's most revolutionary ally. Mixing in dialogue with action, story, and sometimes comedy all moving into a single package is utterly difficult, but Greengrass along with the writers and editor - Christopher Rouse - accomplish such a feat. The fact is every scene demands your attention for the thrill and curiosity we have about Bourne. That I walked away elated, not exhausted, was a testament to the power of good filmmaking that invests in characters while delivering some of the cinema's best action.</p>

                    <p><cite>Ultimatum</cite> follows Bourne on his "last" mission to try to circumvent around the Central Intelligence Agency in joint with the National Security Agency. We follow Bourne uncovering the last clues while it seems against all odds as the CIA do everything in their power to outsmart him.</p>

                    <p>The answers to Jason Bourne's history with the CIA are discovered. Damon develops the character to his utmost potential. The climax is raw and powerful and in complete contrast to his beginnings, and, as the the film depicts, the CIA. In irony is a shot of the American flag on the CIA director's desk as he acknowledges Jason Bourne. The only major supporting character introduced in Ultimatum, Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn is crucial to everyone in the story. Straithairn allows his character to boil until he explodes - powerfully in his expedition mounted on Bourne.</p>

                    <p>All said, Ultimatum is a great action movie - one of the best ever with Identity and Supremacy. To say the finale was merely satisfying is an understatement, it was exhilarating.</p>
