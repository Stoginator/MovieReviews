    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>There’s a moment in <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> when Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is driving a boat with his back to the steering wheel. He is handcuffed and can’t see where he’s going. Having just escaped from the bad guys and dealing with lots of life issues, he is still steering the boat like a professional. As a stunt man, he “knows a thing or two about a thing or two.” Seavers pulls a massive u-turn and uses a boardwalk to launch the boat into the air – and makes an impressively clean landing. Seavers looks around, likely thinking, <q>Did anyone see that?</q></p>

                    <p>Nope.</p>

                    <p>That’s the running joke of <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> – and any action movie ever made. For example, when <a href="https://youtu.be/NR-R_H9JJ4I?si=-4pJC5NTHJuNfqLr&t=166">Brad Pitt ejects himself off a bullet train going 200 miles-per-hour while holding on to a seatbelt for dear life</a> in 2022’s <cite>Bullet Train</cite>, he might <em>not</em> be the guy in every shot.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>As you saw, Brad Pitt is a special actor who does many of his own stunts. I apologize if I defamed his reputation and he actually did all his stunts in <cite>Bullet Train</cite>. However, did you recognize the owner of 87Eleven, David Leitch? He was Brad Pitt’s stunt double – and is the future director of <cite>Bullet Train</cite> and <cite>The Fall Guy</cite>.</p>

                    <p>He has been a massive force behind-the-scenes in so many big, Hollywood movies, but he doesn’t get the love from audiences. That’s okay, he doesn’t want any roses (although that would be cool of you), but he does want to set the facts straight. <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> begins with a montage of great stunt work in well-known films from Universal Pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JwwHjS73qZU?si=hNkzuZ3wVgoJ5ZHq&t=217">Paul Walker, rest in peace, probably wasn’t the guy</a> in 2011’s <cite>Fast Five</cite> who jumped off a moving train onto the hood of Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) sports car. <a href="https://youtu.be/LOVgTjeg4fY?si=XKagkzL_Y2U8K5x6&t=94">Matt Damon probably wasn’t the guy</a> who got launched by a car explosion in Tangiers in 2007’s <cite>The Bourne Ultimatum</cite>. Those are not the only allusions to Universal’s catalog; trust me, there are about a hundred movie references packed into <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> (seriously).</p>

                    <p><em>Script Note</em>: I wonder how many were originally in Drew Pierce’s script and how many got added by the cast and crew. I enjoyed them … maybe too much. I’m told I have issues with that.</p>

                    <p><em>Back to the plot</em>: Stunt work is so seamless these days that we often do not suspect otherwise. <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> is on a mission to fix that: to engender some love for the stunt performers that make those famous moments. This movie is like <cite>Avatar</cite> for stunt performers; its famous line applies here in spades: <q>I see you!</q></p>

                    <p><cite>The Fall Guy</cite> spends much of its runtime on movie sets. There is a certain palace intrigue as we look in on the orderly chaos of those preparing a big shot: visual effects artists, props masters, special effects coordinators, camera operators, sound recorders, stunt performers, producers, and actors. How many am I missing?</p>

                    <p>The problems of a business come along on a movie set, too. What if someone doesn’t show up to work? What is the back-up plan if a crucial explosion in the movie can’t go off during the shoot: <q>The pyrotechnics better work, bro!</q> Did the prop designer not hear the director’s explicit instructions to not make the laser gun look like a guitar? We didn’t get the shot we needed - and we don’t have the extra time or money to get it. Now what?</p>

                    <p>All those creative issues come up before the biggest pain in the butt: studio interference. There are so many horror stories out there that I’m not sure what to believe. Gail (Hannah Waddingham), the producer of the science-fiction romance being filmed in <cite>The Fall Guy</cite>, says, <q>The studio is so far up my butt that I can almost taste them.</q> The boss always wants a word, especially when it is likely that more cash will fly out the door than will come back. Everyone gets antsy when they think they’ve made a bad bet, especially one worth north of one hundred million dollars.</p>

                    <p>When you see the number of problems that pop up in the day-to-day of a film production, I can’t fathom how all the movies I love turned out so good - and I feel much more forgiving about all the others. Making movies is hard.</p>

                    <p>I love how many films <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> manages to reference (I mentioned that already, didn’t I) – and how much fun it pokes at Hollywood. It is filled with quotes, parodies, and straight-up mockery of Hollywood’s successes, failures, and culture. Here is a supreme example: I never expected Emily Blunt’s character Jody to fight with the scrappy usefulness of Jason Bourne. She wields a pen to stab an alien in the thigh <em>and then</em> pushes a binder into its neck – and <em>punches</em> it! I appreciated those not-so-subtle callbacks. As for the obvious, <a href="https://youtu.be/BdtiYwSP9ko?si=tpZzj6sue0s1OIWV&t=284">there is one parody</a> of a great science-fiction movie that had me rolling.</p>

                    <p>Because of all that is packed into a two-hour runtime, <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> exists with a very meta-flavor. The characters are not aware they are in a movie (i.e., there is no breaking of the fourth wall), but they are aware of all the movies we are thinking about. I’m not sure what that means. Is it like breaking the fourth wall through subtext because the characters know we know the same movies?</p>

                    <p><em>The point is</em>: <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> was made with rewatch-ability in mind because you can keep finding gold in the dialogue, the sets, and even the blocking. It also features some amazing one-shots. From what I remember, they all happen on a movie set, showing off both the stability and chaos that is possible. I am sure there is stuff buried in this movie that no one has found yet.</p>

                    <p>To quote Jeff Daniels's character, Mr. Gornicke, in 2006’s <cite>RV</cite>, after watching <cite>The Fall Guy</cite>, I was <q>filled with chagrin.</q> I wondered why, in close to eighty reviews, I never mentioned the work of a stunt team. That one is on me. I suspect that is what <cite>The Fall Guy</cite> will do for many moviegoers. </p>

                    <p>The love letter it writes to the stunt community - and movie-making - opens another dimension of movies for normies to discover. So much so that when we rewatch old favorites, it will be like seeing them anew. I know I’ll be asking, <q>How in the hell did they pull that off?</q> and <q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4oJaGflW5w">Come on, man, Ryan Gosling didn't jump on to a helicopter after driving off a ramp.</a></q> (Please don’t sue me.)</p>
