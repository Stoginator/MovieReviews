                <q class="review-subtitle">To explore new worlds</q>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Beyond</cite> starts off with a new beginning with director Justin Lin, no Abrams this time around. It's far from the explosive, loud, and "exciting" entrances that the previous two films made. It would be described as typical, not like the first two films.</p>

                    <p>It is refreshing to hear Lin's take on the Enterprise's five-year mission <q>to explore new worlds</q>. Kirk offers an interesting monologue on the state of the crew and his take on their journey. <cite>Beyond</cite> starts off with an utterly reflective version of Kirk. Spending over three years in space has made Kirk start to reevaluate himself as he tells Bones, <q>My father joined Starfleet because he believed in it. I joined on a dare.</q></p>

                    <p>Krall is the name of <cite>Beyond</cite>'s singular villain with massive army at his command. He is not a complex villain, like the Joker, nor is he interesting enough, but as usual, he gets the job done. His transformation into an enemy of the Federation is debatable, although he offers some great makeup. The film may not open on action, but the wait time is more than earned when it occurs.</p>

                    <p>There is a scene where the signature song of the series, <cite>Sabotage</cite> by the Beastie Boys, takes over an amazing scene and retraces the film back to its roots from the 2009 film. <cite>Beyond</cite> undoubtedly attempts to send this series back to its original origins and succeeds, but an argument can be made that it shouldn't. Keeping the characters and the world, as established with Into Darkness, was enough.</p>

                    <p>The visual effects in Beyond are, in a single word, gargantuan. Shown in the movie is the space-city of Yorktown (no idea why that is the name) which has Inception-style visuals of cities upside-down, sideways, and all on top of each other. Another are the bees. When you see it, you'll know.</p>

                    <p>One of the <cite>Beyond</cite>'s flaws is not exploring Kirk, Spock, and Bones deeper, but hitting the beats established or heavily implied through the first or second film. One attached to these characters could only hope to understand them even better. But, I can't complain, at least Bones has more lines to flatter us over.</p>
