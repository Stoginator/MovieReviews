    				<p><cite>Oppenheimer</cite> is the definitive way for the modern viewer to witness the impact of the atomic bomb. Almost all alive today did not live through the stakes of World War II: the fight for a rules-based world order whose outcome was never preordained. However my words read on the page, reading the facts of the war is an order of magnitude different from experiencing those tribulations. The consequences do not get higher than a race against time to secure one way of life over another. The context and environment onscreen in <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> help us viscerally understand: Why did the United States develop the atomic bomb? Who led its development? What were the consequences of progress, especially for the man who unleashed the greatest destructive force we have ever seen?</p>

                    <p>Only a few filmmakers can release a film to great cultural fanfare on name alone. I arrived at the movie theater thirty minutes before showtime only to discover a long line of 250 people waiting to enter. I asked the folks first in line when they arrived: <q>An hour ago.</q> This was a weekday IMAX showing that would end at midnight. I was happily late. Christopher Nolan makes spectacular event films that demand a viewing in the movie theater, focusing on stories that are best told as a movie. This film will introduce one of our most important scientists to millions around the world - forever.</p>

                    <p>When I learned about the Manhattan Project in middle school, I was never taught about its project director: J. Robert Oppenheimer. Chemistry class introduced me to his contemporaries: Neils Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Erroneously, my history notebooks cite Albert Einstein as a key contributor to the Manhattan Project; so far as I know, he only co-wrote a letter to FDR that jumpstarted development. Oppenheimer verified their theories in the most important scientific experiment of the era, operating in total secrecy while being funded and abetted by the United States government.</p>

                    <p>For most of its runtime, <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> places the viewer inside its titular character’s mind. One of director Christopher Nolan’s characters in 2020’s <cite>Tenet</cite> says, <q>Don’t try to understand it. Feel it.</q> Inside the mind of Oppenheimer, we see particles buzzing, interacting, circling. A chaotic mess that is a display of the fundamentals of the world. Oppenheimer’s imagination is filled with quantum physics long before most physicists took the field seriously. He is a man possessed by his scientific view of the world desperately trying to assemble it into knowledge. To paraphrase Oppenheimer in the film, his childhood dream was to connect his favorite place in the world, his ranch in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to his love of physics.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Christopher Nolan does not shy away from complexity; he embraces it as a lever to keep audiences engaged. Oppenheimer’s internal state of mind is carefully balanced with his worldly agenda. To that end, <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> is a cacophony of non-stop dialogue. It demands repeat viewings as it crisscrosses from its frame story to flashbacks and goes between different perspectives. I sure as <i>hell</i> did not catch most of it, but it sports enough surprise, subtext, and subtlety to keep returning. Moreover, the ultimate point is made without catching every bit of dialogue. An amazing supporting cast helps contextualize the people around Oppenheimer, but the standout is Cillian Murphy whose expressions take us inside Oppenheimer’s world again and again. Frankly, many of his contemporaries are quite uninteresting compared to Oppenheimer himself. </p>

                    <p>But, there are some outstanding roles. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) is the sardonic general who approves and denies Oppenheimer’s requests on the Manhattan Project. Groves offers a steady dose of humor and packs the first wallop on Oppenheimer when they enter the new world. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) is Oppenheimer's equal half - relegated to the unfulfilling duties of housewife. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) is Oppenheimer’s foil, a man of the military-industrial complex who seeks to punish Oppenheimer for fame he believes should be his own. Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) is one of the only scientists that Oppenheimer can confide in. Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) has the best lines of the movie, placing previous events into perspective each time he appears.</p>

                    <p>The most compelling moments of the film are IMAX-sized close-ups of Oppenheimer which are juxtaposed against increasingly grave imagery. It is an experimental film technique that I learned about from 1982’s <cite>Koyaanisqatsi</cite>, placing images together over music without any dialogue. The goal is to create a sequence of images that suggest a greater idea.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Bringing this technique into the mainstream, Nolan uses the transition from Oppenheimer’s face to scientific imagery as a means into his mind: first comes benign particle physics, then comes the implosions of stars, the raging fire of nuclear fission, the catastrophe of nuclear fusion, the mass production of bombs, the firing of warheads, and the assured destruction of the world. These shots, the surrounding music, and the diegetic sounds convey his thinking more intensely than I can describe with words. It is impossible to separate yourself from the moment. Christopher Nolan has a unique style of overwhelming the audiovisual senses so that it becomes impossible to separate yourself from the viewing experience. Seeing it on a huge screen and hearing it loud in an IMAX auditorium only helps.</p>

                    <p>As a film, <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> was never about elaborating on the scientific intricacies of the atomic bomb, but rather experiencing its power. While the Trinity Test is a great marketing tool to get us in the seat (even though Nolan’s name is the main ticket-seller), it delivers. The film begins with:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.<br><br>For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity."</blockquote> 

                    In the race for an A-bomb that locks in a final advantage to end the war, the nature of discovery fuels relentless forward motion; the film marches in lockstep. As the first bomb detonates and the plume of nuclear ash rises into the night sky, the film grinds to a halt. A new world is entered as the propulsive force of discovery turns into a potential for great destructive capacity. The terror of atomic fire lingers and the visceral display of its power horrifies. We are left wondering whether Oppenheimer is living the tragedy of Prometheus.</p>

                    <p>For creating the bomb, Oppenheimer becomes wracked with a hidden guilt. Believing the bomb was a necessary evil to ensure peace provides no comfort. He receives no solace from the U.S. government for his significant contribution either. After the war ends, Oppenheimer faces great opposition as he tries to influence policy. Having previous encounters with Communist influences amongst his family and in his professional life, Oppenheimer was defamed during the Red Scare and vehemently pursued as a likely communist sympathizer. His disposition towards this external punishment was to yield and bravely face the aggression from Strauss and Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), the hard-questioning lawyer looking to take away Oppenheimer’s security clearance. I suspect he thought that his defamation was the world getting even – that maybe future generations would look more kindly on his actions if he faced public scrutiny and humiliation. In effect, he tortures himself for a sin he had to commit.</p>

                    <p>Helping take us into Oppenheimer’s mind is composer Ludwig Göransson’s score. I revisited the score on a long car drive. There are a few cues that stuck with me. <cite>Can You Hear The Music</cite> initially plays like a track from 2014’s <cite>The Theory of Everything</cite> following the directionless adventures of a precocious school boy in England. Heavy orchestral notes quickly merge with Oppenheimer’s theme becoming a launching pad into his head - a place where optimism is alive for what can be done with quantum physics. <cite>American Prometheus</cite> shows him coming into his own, becoming the famous academic with a top hat, a suit, and his smoking pipe. <cite>Destroyer of Worlds</cite> finds the audience at the end of the journey. A man who has fully realized the possessions of his mind in the world and is now mentally tortured by the consequences.</p>

                    <p>During the film, I was surprised that Oppenheimer’s theme was mainly a synthesizer, an instrument unassociated with typical World War II compositions. How could an instrument that was not invented until the early 1960s be used to characterize Oppenheimer? It was a question that puzzled me until I discovered the creative intuition hidden in plain sight. Oppenheimer was such a radical thinker, bringing to life an entirely new realm of physics, that no physicist "rang a similar tune" so-to-speak. When Robert Oppenheimer walked into a room, it was not just a man entering. The father of the atomic bomb was the myth; it bestowed the man with the stature of legend. Other physicists were of the era, but it was Oppenheimer who defined it.</p>

                    <p>The setup, the Trinity Test, and the aftermath all attempt to drive home one central concept: to make the audience feel how Oppenheimer felt in his moments of history. Piecing together meaning from atomic structure. A race against the Nazis. Knowing why he was consumed by a passage in the Bhagavad Gita: <q>I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.</q> His ploy to create international rules around atomic weapons. The film is a labyrinth of conversations, but the cumulative impact of years of decisions and realizations – and three hours of storytelling - reaches its peak at the very end. It has always been said that “mutually assured destruction” is the outcome of any nuclear attack but feeling the weight of those words in your bones is this film’s final destination.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the show, the effect of the film made everyone eerily quiet. There was no applause; I did not overhear anyone gushing over the technical wizardry. This film makes you take on Oppenheimer’s afflictions, caused by the most epic sense of circumstances the world has ever seen. His theoretical and managerial brilliance in a crisis, his guilt of creating the atomic bomb, his demise from his role as project director, his late-stage graciousness to those who betrayed his trust, and his desolate vision of the future. Imagine your childhood dream becoming your defining, living nightmare – and the greatest terror in the world. This was an experience only possible at the movies.</p>

                <p class="review-subtitle"><time datetime="20238-19 14:50">August 19, 2023 - 2:50 PM</time> - IMAX 70mm</p>
                <q class="review-subtitle">Theory will only take you so far.</q>
                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>In one of <a href="https://www.imax.com/news/oppenheimer-in-imax-70mm">only 30 IMAX theaters</a> around the globe showing <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> on 70-millimeter IMAX film, I had the awesome luck of being close enough to visit and sit in the sweet spot. Being able to take in the dialogue, I stand by my original write-up in full. Even one month after the release, my showing was sold-out yet again due to <cite>Oppenheimer's</cite> <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/oppenheimer-imax-70mm-craze-projectors-1235697085/">massive performance in these theaters</a>.</p>

                    <p>The jumbo popcorn container rumbled. This IMAX played the movie <em>loud</em>! I am glad they did because it was an awe-inspiring sound mix. For the most part, dialogue felt clear. The music was extraordinary to hear in the theater. I smiled when Oppenheimer walks around Los Alamos in his own clothes to the tune of <cite>American Prometheus</cite>. I flinched multiple times to the loud bursts and <em>boooooms</em> of the explosive tests. I was left speechless after Oppenheimer's vision set to <cite>Destroyer of Worlds</cite>. The full range of IMAX's subwoofers were tested - all the way down to 20 Hz. Although my ears need a break, this felt like the world's best creation of how movie theaters were meant to sound. I have never heard it better.</p>

                    <p>The IMAX film projector system is a great feat of engineering. How can a 70-millimeter piece of film illuminate a screen the size of a building? What kind of light bulb powers this? When spliced together from the individual reels, <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> is 11-miles long and weighs over 600 pounds. This massive platter of film is sent through the projector every showtime. When I saw <cite>Oppenheimer</cite>, the platter had been shown over 120 times, yet there were only a few signs of wear-and-tear - almost all reserved for the non-IMAX 70mm sections of the film. The projectionists and the IMAX film system preserve the original celluloid remarkably well.</p>

                    <p>In terms of the movie experience, watching this film print was a thing of beauty. Seeing real, illuminated, physical frames that are one or two generations away from the actual camera prints is a great engineering achievement and a remarkable artistic endeavor. In a movie theater, this is the closest we can get to lossless audio and video. Where I sat, the intercutting between massive 1.43:1 (IMAX) imagery and 2.20:1 (regular) imagery was usually unnoticable, but it often announced itself as a large downtick in visible detail and an uptick in grain.</p>

                    <p>The color space of IMAX 70mm is not something I have ever noticed before. Compared to dual-laser IMAX projection, skin tones felt incredibly tangible - like the faces I see everyday, but captured with infinite detail. I caught - and learned - pieces of the ensemble's performances that I never saw before: Matt Damon's facial ticks when he becomes angry and the blue stillness of Cilian Murphy's eyes. The particle abstractions in Oppenheimer's mind were just jaw-dropping - not only from a practical standpoint of wondering "How did they do that?", but as a visual spectacle. When the atomic test goes off, did you see the neutrons colliding and catching the light? The theory from Oppenheimer's mind arrives into real life. In this format, the appearances of "movies" are completely lost; it feels like only reality is left.</p>

                    <p>After Round Two, I thought about the breadth of stories that Christopher Nolan has told about the wonder of space travel, the nature of time, and the major, yet unshown events of World War II. Particularly, it is special how he allures moviegoers across generations. In the parking lot after my showing, an elderly couple were walking ahead ruminating aloud on the arc of Oppenheimer's story and how it affected them. For my generation, it was simply a fact of life that we live in a nuclear age. I did not have a visceral understanding of what that meant - until I experienced this movie.</p>
