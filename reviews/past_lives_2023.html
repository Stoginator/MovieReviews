    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Past Lives</cite> is a response to a silent call. In the past few years, I have discovered a building desire to see the full spectrum of American stories on screen. Titles that come to mind are <cite>Mare of Easttown</cite>, <cite>Bridge of Spies</cite>, <cite>Green Book</cite>, <cite>The Wire</cite>, and <cite>Master of None</cite> - each powerful works of art. Slowly, artists are convincing Hollywood to exhibit these stories for general audiences. <cite>Past Lives</cite> is one of the works of art: a uniquely American story about the conflict between reality and destiny. At the center of the film is a universal question: “Is this the way my life was supposed to happen?” Everyone ponders whether the events of our lives were destined or the result of our actions. Writer-director Celine Song places this question at the doorstep of her trio of characters.</p>

                    <p>Our central protagonist is Nora (Greta Lee), a first-generation immigrant from South Korea. Before she left to Canada with her family, she was enamored with a boy, Hae Sung (Teo Too). Their parents believed the two were childhood sweethearts, with marriage just down the road. Their relationship is broken by separation. A romance stalled by distance.</p>

                    <p>Whether the story is a complete fiction or rooted in autobiography is unknown to me. The subtle details placed in the frame - college sweatshirts, names written on a wall, discussion of Montauk - push me to believe the film is based in real events. <cite>Past Lives</cite> has a deliberate pace designed to bond us to Hae Sung and Nora’s relationship; whether or not they end up together, we grow fond of these two. Celine Song displays inordinate restraint in wielding the emotional hammer of this story.</p>

                    <p>More than a decade later, Nora is enjoying her adventures as a writer now living in New York when she stumbles upon Hae Sung’s Facebook account. The two reconnect on Skype (<i>oh, how far we have come</i>) and, due to their time zones, talk at extreme times of the day and night. When the going gets serious, neither can commit to joining the other: Nora cannot return to Korea and Hae Sung cannot come to America. Nora decides to end their Skype dates and embarks on a writers’ retreat surrounded by other artistic minds. This is where she meets Arthur (John Maguro), her future husband. The ratio of time that the film spends on Hae Sung and Nora versus Arthur and Nora struck me as wildly uneven, but the film <i>works</i> anyway! Because of our investment in Nora, the audience naturally extends that warmth to her husband: another thoughtful guy like Hae Sung who happens to be a New Yorker. </p>

                    <p>Contented years go by for Nora and Arthur. Hae Sung, now a thirty-year-old bachelor dissatisfied by his relationships, decides to visit New York solely to see Nora again. Immediately, questions abound. Arthur and Nora ended up together. Is the best story what we think of as destiny? Arthur and Nora’s story is more cookie-cutter and more boring, but does that make it less valid?  The questions that weigh on these characters are not given any answers: <q>Are there questions we shouldn’t ask</q> and <q>What would have happened if you stayed in Seoul?</q> This is where the film exerts its intellect and staying power.</p>

                    <p><cite>Past Lives</cite> plays the audience like a fiddle: we all silently hope that Nora decides to run away with Hae Sung in an embrace of the great story we were told, but we all know that, in reality, pragmatism is going to win. No one can drop their marriage and run away to a place that has become foreign to them. But, isn’t it amazing to think that Nora might! Knowing this, even Arthur doubts his place in Nora’s story.  </p>

                    <p>During the film, Hae Sung and Nora’s day excursions seem to be either friendly hangouts or dates. In memory, they feel similar to grief. Nora is exploring the relationship and then trying to let go, while Hae Sung ponders the unspoken: <q>Are we together in future lives?</q> The very real chemistry between Greta Lee and Teo Too elevates these scenes, and the film, by keeping us hanging on every word and every glance.</p>

                    <p>Eventually, Nora tells Hae Sung, <q>This is where I am supposed to be.</q> It struck me as having two possible meanings: rationalizing why the two cannot be together or Nora simply sharing the whole, honest truth. When she cries after his departure, has she fully let go of a life in South Korea or is she making the easier decision to stay with her husband? Have worldly circumstances like a current marriage and distance obscured the path between soulmates? What makes this story fresh is it depends on who you ask.</p>

                    <p>I do not know Nora’s mind, but I believe one events offers a clue (or an exquisite misdirection). Spending a day together, Hae Sung and Nora visit the Statue of Liberty by boat: an ode to Nora’s immigrant story. Maybe on the trip, Nora decides that <i>this</i>, the American experience, is my story. When the two meet Arthur for dinner, Arthur mentions that he has never been on the boat tour. Why did Nora never take him there? It could be an innocuous event, but everything exists in the story for a reason. Before Hae Sung came to town, was the story Nora told herself different? Is it a convenient story to sever their connection? Is she denying herself a fairytale ending because she wants to let go of the little girl? Does Nora believe that with all her heart? Most likely, Nora does not know her own answer, but she knows the choice she must make.</p>

                    <p><i>Past Lives</i> is a film that leaves you in a melancholy state of reflection. These characters share a sense of trauma that only time can fade away. Beyond asking myself, what would I do if I were in any of these characters’ situation, the film is bound to bring up old stories and events long past. Why is it that we ended up where we are? The scientific answer is mere probability and coincidence, but that has never satisfied a soul. Our universal sense of destiny is the most human element in all of us. Celine Song tugs at our human chords and asks those questions that make us wonder: <q>Is this where I was meant to be?</q> Her answer: <q>Yes.</q></p>
