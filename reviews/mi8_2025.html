    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (lovingly known as McQ) have done it again.</p>
                    <p>Unlike most Hollywood productions, <cite>Mission</cite> movies are staged around set pieces: Tom climbing the world’s tallest building, Tom running on London rooftops, Tom hanging off a plane during takeoff. Safety crews can only do so much. The world’s biggest movie star-stunt man-combo places himself in significant danger to entertain us. If you watch enough interviews, you’ll catch his signature catchphrase: <q>See you at the movies!</q></p>

                    <p>Cruise’s stunts are the primary building blocks of each film. Other elements, like character and plot, are crafted in response. This process is most similar to video game production, where story is fleshed out last. Story becomes the connective tissue from each set piece to the next. For the most part, the construction of Mission films never feels so obvious while watching. During the theatrical experience, the seams are hidden.</p>

                    <p>This process works because Cruise and McQ are relentless in reexamining their decisions: <q>Does this scene work? No? Then, let’s reshoot it.</q> They are comfortable filming without a typical script because they have a very collaborative and speedy team. They are filming new material, editing scenes, or mixing new music into the movie as late as two days before the picture is locked for distribution. It is astounding that they are able to do this at the pinnacle of big-budget filmmaking.</p>

                    <p>Their methods should not be underestimated: in their hands, it has enormous potential and clear downsides. They made the best action film of the 21st century, 2018’s <cite>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</cite>, in this manner. However, they also made a less-than-stellar, seventh installment, 2023’s <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite>.</p>

                    <p>The audience saw key gaps in that film:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The central team did not grow.</li>
                            <li>The plot was too complicated.</li>
                            <li>The main stunt was advertised to no end, ruining the moment it was finally seen in context.</li>
                            <li>A major character dies in a hollow manner, yet a new character escapes death in ridiculous fashion. With two opposites to compare, the internal logic was broken.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>The audience grated their teeth. In response, Cruise and McQ delivered a successor that is a major course-correction.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>The Final Reckoning</cite>, surprises await! Most set pieces are saved for the film, as they were not revealed in the marketing. Cruise and McQ always create phenomenal set pieces, which are unlikely to be repeated by any other actor-director partnership that we know of today. From Shanghai to Dubai to London and Paris to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPFIOfqZO0">stunning South Africa</a>,” the <cite>Mission</cite> films are sprawling, traveling the globe to capture beautiful geographies. As usual, they have created a satisfying core of a story to motivate them.</p>

                    <p>New characters are memorable, serving their small purpose to the story and ceding screen time to the main cast. <i>The Entity</i>, the machine-turned-villain, makes a tangible threat to humanity, and is no longer just an abstract artificial-intelligence-gone-rogue that governments want to control.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to their filmgoing audience, we know Cruise and McQ are great listeners. But they are also listening to global news. With <cite>Dead Reckoning Part One</cite>, they entered the conversation about artificial general intelligence (AGI), a computer system with abilities far superior to any group of humans. Its abilities in our digital spaces can be used in malicious ways: erasing criminals from security camera footage, impersonating someone in a phone call, or flooding social media with realistic misinformation. Because of how interconnected our physical society is with cyberspace, the trouble really begins when our decisions are unknowingly influenced by an AGI’s planning. For example, consider the following scenario between a couple who broke up a week ago:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Girl: <q>Who told you to meet me here?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Boy: <q>You did. You called me yesterday.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Girl: <q>But I haven’t called you in a week.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>In the coming years, stuff is going to get weird.</p>

                    <p>Attaching two Mission films to AGI was a timeless decision, one that will continue to become more relevant as intelligent computer systems proliferate in our society. Cruise hears the emotion around this subject and McQ operationalizes it into a coherent plot. With the Reckoning films, they have found a way to dramatize “the alignment problem.”</p>

                    <p>In AGI research, the alignment problem addresses how to ensure the outcomes of an intelligent computer system matches humanity’s goals. It is entirely possible that this alignment fails. Such a failure is the doomsday situation presented in <cite>The Final Reckoning</cite>.</p>

                    <p>This dramatic situation is the modern-day equivalent of 1990’s <cite>The Hunt for Red October</cite>. In that film, the questions are: What happens when a Soviet nuclear submarine disappears? Are they a threat or a renegade?</p>

                    <p>In <cite>The Final Reckoning</cite>, the question is: What happens when an unaligned AGI gets direct access to nuclear weapon silos? It is a scenario I hope we never confront.</p>

                    <p>However, it sets up a terrific dramatic situation that coats the film in a novel sense of uneasiness. Ethan Hunt hasn’t failed to stop humans, but he could fail to stop a machine god. Is this one of those times? We are all outmatched by an AGI. Is Ethan Hunt outmatched? I expect the gravity of this plot to seep into other movies and television. Here’s a stat no one expected: with this duology, Cruise and McQ have bested James Cameron’s two <cite>Terminator</cite> films at the box office (unadjusted for inflation). Get ready for AGI-mania.</p>

                    <p>Of course, Cruise and McQ embrace novelty with all the hallmarks of a <cite>Mission</cite> film, which is a package deal. Facial masks are included, someone’s dialogue incorporates the film’s title, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7mj2yzoEKSqa6l4Oqmltm0">the theme music</a> is front and center. Some of the plot falls apart under closer inspection, so it is important to remember: Emotional truth is what this team prioritizes. If Ethan Hunt survives something other people would not, that is the point. If it feels right, that is a win in Cruise and McQ’s book.</p>

                    <p>Given the order of story in their process, it is difficult to avoid blocks of dialogue-driven exposition between set pieces. In commentaries and interviews, they comment on their repeated attempts to dramatize exposition without dialogue, but often relent. Sometimes, you just have to say it aloud. Extended dialogue scenes become the main delivery mechanism to explain why the team is doing something. It’s a known problem to Cruise and McQ - and, in most cases, it is unavoidable.</p>

                    <p>There are trade-offs. <cite>The Final Reckoning</cite> has scenes of total word salad, where I could not maintain the pace. I found myself confused about why events were occurring. On the other hand, there is a montage between Ethan and The Entity that provoked anxiety in a way that no dialogue scene could accomplish. Coincidently, it is a stand-out scene that was finished two days before picture lock. Given Cruise and McQ’s process, these montages don’t appear obvious until the film has a rough cut. Once they find a spot for improvement, their attitude is “Let’s make it happen.” Sometimes, they just run out of time.</p>

                    <p>The great achievement of <cite>The Final Reckoning</cite> — and the entire <cite>Mission</cite> series — is motivating the great action set pieces of our time with character and story. No matter how the films landed, Cruise and McQ kept the action in-camera. Tom Cruise is truly scaling the Burj Khalifa, hanging off a plane, holding his breath underwater for six minutes, and flying helicopters in New Zealand. Seen on an IMAX screen with a full bucket of popcorn and an ICEE, it is moviegoing meth.</p>

                    <p>This “finale” (because who really knows) salutes its seven predecessors, which is a legendary body of work spanning twenty-nine years. For Tom Cruise, each <cite>Mission</cite> film is an attempt to deliver the most engaging adventures ever put on film.</p>

                    <p>When each film is released, Cruise and McQ hit the media circuit, visiting tens of countries in a few weeks. They premiere the film in country after country, learning from how audiences take in each moment of the film. When the credits roll, no matter the reaction, Cruise turns to McQ and says,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>We can do better.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>In 2020 and 2021, no one knew if movie theaters would be open. No one knew if we would escape COVID. But Tom Cruise and McQ kept the industry alive, continuing production on the duology when the future of movies was very uncertain.</p>

                    <p>Even after all the gut-wrenching stunts, dealing with production delays during COVID, and handling the pressure of sustaining the film industry on their backs, they still found the joy. They want to excel.<q>We can do better</q> captures the spirit in which this series was made.</p>

                    <p>Each <cite>Mission</cite> movie is an experiment in delivering action, with the goal of improving every time. It will be missed, but Cruise and McQ know better than anyone: Film lives forever. With the contributions of thirty years of crews, theater workers, and moviegoers, <cite>Mission: Impossible</cite> is eternal.</p>
