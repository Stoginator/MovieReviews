    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Society of the Snow</cite> is a film that pushes the audience to the limit of acceptable experience. In a dramatic interpretation of a real-life event, our cast of characters are Uruguayan survivors of a plane crash, living in the remaining wreckage somewhere in the Andes Mountains. With artistic direction, the emotions that the characters feel find their way to the audience: distress, nail-biting tension, and absolute dread. </p>

                    <p>With the wonderful eye of director J.A. Bayona, <cite>Society of the Snow</cite> achieves the gold standard of the survival film: to place the audience beside characters facing their own mortality. The specificity of this true story has produced images that cannot be struck from my mind: a leg crushed by the force of a plane crash; survivors ascending a mountain slope like zombies; teeth loosened through malnutrition; frozen bodies emerging out of the snow during the sunrise; hands warmed through self-urination. In a way that no news article or book can do, this group’s unfathomable reality is recreated with tremendous detail and emotional heft.</p>

                    <p>The film uses practical locations to consume the characters in a winter abyss. Even if the characters scale a massive peak, where do we go from there? The breadth of the Andes Mountain Range is its own obstacle to survival. There must be CGI hidden in this film; it is an achievement that it never jerked us out of our misery.</p>

                    <p>After enduring setback after setback, finally, there is a rescue, powered by overwhelming feelings of happiness, cheer, and sweeping orchestral music. When it happens in <cite>Society of the Snow</cite>, it is deserved. The plight of these characters has been our emotional plight; now, their euphoria is our delight. It does not last.</p>

                    <p>It is a common trope in survival movies that we know the protagonist will find a way to survive. They are special to us. We believe in them – until they are very painfully taken away from us. In <cite>Society of the Snow</cite>, we lose Numa (Enzo Vogrincic). As an actor, Vogrincic is magnetic in his scenes; we immediately stick to his performance and root for his character to find a way, even if it ultimately means trading dignity for sustenance. It is only when Numa dies that we emotionally reckon with the magnitude of human loss among these survivors.</p>

                    <p>Sixteen people survived through over sixty days of freezing nights and terrible choices. Twenty-nine did not. After experiencing this story, I had forgotten for a time what was happening in my own reality. Mundane activities like drinking water, turning on a heater, or sleeping in a warm bed stopped feeling so ordinary. </p>

                    <p>Narration in films almost always comes from living characters, not the dead. Throughout the film and especially after the survivors make it back to civilization, <cite>Society of the Snow</cite> speaks through one of the lost souls of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571: Numa. The point of his concluding narration is you are alive. That is a precious opportunity.</p>

                    <p>The young members of this flight were heading out for a fun weekend – and got something they never imagined. Make it count.</p>
