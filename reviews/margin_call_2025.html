    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Set on the top floors of a Wall Street firm, 2011’s <cite>Margin Call</cite> begins with suited men and women entering a trading floor. Three traders anxiously look on. Within seconds, their feeling of dread creeps off the screen as we realize what is happening: this is a mass layoff. Who approved the downsizing? Who is getting sent home?</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“You guys been through this before? … Keep your head down and go back to work.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The exposition in <cite>Margin Call</cite> is brilliant - using character reactions to depict the power structure of the firm. On this mundane floor, executives hide in their offices, while analysts hunker down at the desks - praying a human resources employee does not call their name.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the environmental storytelling, the conflict in <cite>Margin Call</cite> comes from each employee’s survival instinct. Why? Getting the job isn’t easy. These bankers are members of an exclusive club where junior analysts make more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year. The longer you last, the more you make. From our perspective looking in, the longer you stay, the more you change.</p>

                    <p>On the evening after the downsizing, an analyst (Zachary Quinto) uncovers an unsettling conclusion, hidden in the firm’s financial data. He wants validation. Does his boss see it too? The problem is: his boss doesn’t know how to read the model. What these bankers do is a true puzzle. However, you assume that they understand what they’re doing. Not exactly.</p>

                    <p>Taking the analyst at his word, the conclusion is worrying enough that Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) phones in his boss. The news makes it way up the chain. Even Emerson’s boss needs the results explained to him. The model is so complex that the executives cannot explain it in simple terms. Yet, they must react to its inference. They know that their firm is a crisis that could undo their way of life - within hours.</p>

                    <p><cite>Margin Call</cite> earns its emotional weight from its basis in reality. Released in 2011, the world was not fully out of the 2008 financial crisis. Everyone was affected, but few knew what actually happened inside the banks. How did the crisis initially play out? Fourteen years later, the events have not lost their potency.</p>

                    <p>For a relatively small budget of 3.5 million dollars, writer-director J.C. Chandor assembled a lights-out cast of Oscar nominees due to strength of his script and its subject matter. While 2010’s Inside Job is the flagship documentary on the 2008 financial crisis from an outsider’s perspective, <cite>Margin Call</cite> was the first dramatization of its events from inside the storm.</p>

                    <p>J.C. Chandor has a father in investment banking, which likely gave him insights into the financial world. What <cite>Margin Call</cite> gets absolutely correct about the modern workplace is the segregation of information. The higher you go in the corporate hierarchy, the more information you have available. A low-level analyst is piecing things together from what little they know. Writer-director J.C. Chandor recreates this environment onscreen - and loops the audience into the confusion. The audience has an outsider’s view.</p>

                    <p>We come with palace intrigue, with a set of simple assumptions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The executives know what is going on.</li>
                        <li>They are in their positions due to their ability to make good decisions.</li>
                        <li>They will put the firm’s best interests first.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The more time we spend with these bankers, the more we see how vapid their way of life seems to be. They worship at the altar of a higher paycheck - seeking the items of wealth: clothes, cars, castles. Today’s executives were promoted because they found a way to make more money for yesterday's leadership. However, when the stakes are high, you’re either a winner or a loser. Self-preservation is the only rule.</p>

                    <p>After the downsizing, the bankers left standing tell each other <q>I’m still alive.</q> To lose their lifestyle - of mansion-living, luxury cars, and designer clothing - would be painful. But, what really burns is the loss of importance. These bankers tell themselves that they are essential workers. It is the only way that they can justify selling complex financial instruments for years - with no awareness of the consequences.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“The only reason [normal people] get to continue living like kings is ‘cause we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really f**kin’ fair really f**kin’ quickly and nobody actually wants that.”</blockquote>

                    <p>When you believe that, losing your position as a banker is a humiliation. As we see in the decisions they make, being humiliated is a fate worse than tanking the entire American economy.</p>

                    <p>Within <cite>Margin Call</cite> lies an insight into the other landmark films about Wall Street: 2010’s <cite>Inside Job</cite>, 2013’s <cite>The Wolf of Wall Street</cite> and 2015’s <cite>The Big Short</cite>. It is an short-sighted to say that the defining motivation behind these onscreen bankers is greed. By making as much money possible by any means necessary, they are desperately trying to keep their sense of status alive at any cost. These bankers learn to live by a code: There are only two outcomes. I win or I lose. And I will not lose.</p>

                    <p><cite>Margin Call</cite> is the story of how a top Wall Street firm self-immolates in forty-eight hours, by unloading billions in mortgage-backed securities that were actually worthless. They could have taken the fall, enduring the fate they deserved. Instead, they made all the money they could selling overpriced junk to unaware buyers. When the buyers find out, this firm will never make another deal again. But that’s okay - these bankers all escaped the impending financial crisis as winners.</p>

                    <p>The film has a delayed fuse; it took me a few hours to fully process the drama of this workplace - and it left me stunned. The film neglects to show the outcomes of their decisions on society. We know the real-life stories all too well. In a film, the way in which a few characters act can have dramatic consequences for their onscreen world. But is that true in real life?</p>

                    <p>Do we really live in a world where a few individuals’ decisions, based on personal ambition, can turn our world upside-down? <cite>Margin Call</cite> is dramatic evidence to the affirmative: Yes, we do.</p>

                    <p>When these characters were faced with the consequences of their decisions, they doubled down - knowing that their actions could end the very financial games they devoted their lives to. <cite>Margin Call</cite> is a film that helps you deeply understand why. Would we have done any differently?</p>
