    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>As a relative newcomer to Noah Baumbach’s films, I was pleasantly surprised by his filmmaking voice. If you listen to the dialogue in <cite>Frances Ha</cite> (which he co-wrote with the film’s star, Greta Gerwig), the sound and rhythm is meant to capture the feeling of real conversation: uncontrived and natural. A cardinal rule of scriptwriting is that dialogue is not real-life conversation. Dialogue must be essential, delivering information and advance the story; every moment in life is not art. However, if you listen closely, <cite>Frances Ha</cite> accomplishes something wonderful: replicating the flow and sound of real conversations while ensuring the dialogue is essential. Notes of dialogue that seem irrelevant when said will come back to make you laugh, make a moment poignant, or induce a gaping smile. It is a horribly difficult stunt to execute.</p>

                    <p>None of these characters mean what they say literally. There are very few scenes when characters build on each other’s sentences – which is more common in other films. Most of <cite>Frances Ha</cite> features characters speaking past each other, obfuscating their true intentions or feelings with euphemisms. Except when characters are inebriated, this dialogue cannot be taken at face value; in other words, it must be decoded. Call me crazy, but I enjoy how much it requires participation from the audience.</p>

                    <p>Take one of the opening scenes with Frances (Greta Gerwig) and her only boyfriend. As he asks her if she wants to move in, she carefully evades his request with a non-answer. They talk past each other and struggle to clearly communicate – saying things they clearly do not mean. If the dialogue is taken literally, you would believe that they move in together. After the scene ends, it is discussed that the characters broke up and are not moving in.</p>

                    <p>A few years ago, I would not been able to keep up with <cite>Frances Ha</cite>. I would hilariously have described it as “a slice-of-life movie where nothing happens” and moved on. But, I have seen too many films to render such a lazy description. <cite>Frances Ha</cite> is anything but an “easy” film to make.</p>

                    <p>The movie would not work without making Frances a deeply empathetic character. To that end, I find <em>something</em> incredibly endearing about Frances: is it her desire to artistically express herself through dancing, how she cannot afford a studio apartment, or her most desperate, inner plea to not be isolated from her best friend, Sophie? Maybe it was her public humiliations: her inability to make rent, her crashing of a dinner party, or her release from her dance company. There were intensely anxious moments where I both feared the idea of being in Frances’s shoes and related to her encoded dialogue – where she is begging anyone to understand her. After viewing the film, thinking about France’s journey is amazing: how did Baumbach and Gerwig compress the essence of a person into eighty minutes?</p>

                    <p>I see a lot of myself in Frances as an old soul struggling through life and trying to piece it together. In Frances’s race to realize her dreams, I sense a great truth in the difficulty of her journey and the rollercoaster of rejection and emotion that she endures. She racks up credit-card debt, struggles with the idea of being self-made, and suffers through a too-common syndrome of being digitally connected and humanly distant with her best friend. To me, that means the path ahead is not an easy one. Yet, <cite>Frances Ha</cite> left me reassured: after surmounting her great challenges, Frances found what satisfies her.</p>

                    <p>It has been quite some time since a film has made me break out into a full-toothed smile. I <em>loved</em> the final conversation between Frances and her dance company director – which felt like the sum total of everything Frances experienced on her journey in one moment. Breaking her attention to the director’s praise for her show, Frances makes eye contact with someone across the room. The director asks, <q>Who are you making eyes at?</q> Frances calmly replies, <q>That’s Sophie. She’s my best friend.</q> The conclusion that Frances reaches at the end of this journey offers confirmation to what I suspect many people, including myself, believe. Some human connections are worth their weight in gold.</p>
