    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>The title of Steven Spielberg’s 2005 film, Munich, may appear generic, but it serves two purposes which make it effective. For one thing, it is an immediate reference to the film’s subject matter. Munich refers to the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics, where eleven Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. In the film, the highest levels of the Israeli government authorize a team of agents to perform targeted assassinations on the eleven surviving terrorists, who either planned the attack or carried it out.</p>

                    <p>Secondly, after the film ends, we realize Munich is the source of all we have seen, a tragedy and its aftermath encapsulated in one word. When it is said aloud, it wields an impact in the film similar to the one that 9/11 has on Americans.</p>

                    <p>The signature achievement of Munich is how it constructs an emotional through-line from a single episode of violence to all subsequent events. Like ripples in a pond, the Munich Massacre sets off a cascading series of actions, which mires the team of agents deeper and deeper into conflict and moral ambiguity.</p>

                    <p>As the team progresses further in their mission, they discover that they are in territory where there are no comforting answers. They are on the outskirts of civilized existence, ending lives under cover of darkness and surprise, where no laws or governments will protect them.</p>

                    <p>In some moments, members of the team feel an infection in their very souls. They ask each other: If we cannot save a civilian from collateral damage, do we call off that operation? And they silently question: Are these the men who were there that day? They are wrestling with a moral dilemma: In the words of Abraham Lincoln, must <q>every drop of blood drawn with the lash … be paid by another drawn with the sword?</q> When does the cycle of violence end? While Munich may focus on Israeli intelligence agents in the 1970s, its themes belong to the present as much as the past.</p>

                    <p>How many lives must be taken to avenge the ones you lost? In our responses to violence, should we accept any compromises on the values of our nation? If so, where do we draw the line? And how do we hold it? By drawing us into the perspective of the team’s leader, Avner Kaufman, these are the questions that Spielberg forces us to reckon with.</p>

                    <p>I come to Munich as an outsider. I am neither Israeli nor Palestinian, but I am very conscious of the deep feelings that exist. From the moment that Spielberg, an American Jew, announced his undertaking of such a project, criticism immediately followed. When the film was released, all sides found fault with the depictions of various groups and its factual basis. While he maintains that he has told this story truthfully, Spielberg is not making a documentary, embedded in the exact methods of spy-craft; other films serve that purpose. Spielberg’s highest goal is to immerse the audience in the story’s emotional truth.</p>

                    <p>Each act of violence in Munich is crucial to the story. To approach such heavy subject-matter, Spielberg uses his box of filmmaking tools differently. The look and feel of Munich is immediately recognizable, but it is how the story is presented that hooked me. Munich is not a condemnation or any other form of judgement; rather, it is a film that observes and passes questions to the audience. It is a different form of Spielberg’s filmmaking that <em>requires</em> audience participation. You must analyze your experience of watching the film. You must confront its questions. It is only then that Munich can be understood as Spielberg intends.</p>

                    <p>As most studio movies do, Munich opens on the participating studios’ logos. For a brief moment, it is silent. The string section fades in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0lJ3ws2j8KbAJL0iIf9fLw">And then, a woman’s voice pierces the soundscape</a>. She does not sing in Arabic nor Hebrew, but in words of her own creation. The sound is deliberately uncomfortable because it is a cry of pain. Grief is pouring out. Composer John Williams uses the voice of singer Lisbeth Scott to establish the tone of Munich. The music tells us immediately: In this story, you will be confronted by intense emotions. And you must decide for yourself, what is the proper response?</p>
                    
                    <div class="spoilers">
                        <hr />
                        <p>Spoilers Ahead</p>
                        <hr />
                    </div>

                    <p>The most useful lens to discuss Munich is one that recognizes transformation. Munich’s big questions are discovered through the personal experiences of Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), who leads the assassination squad on eleven targets. The things that Avner sees and does give us an emotional through-line into why Munich’s big questions matter.</p>

                    <p>We first meet Avner, sitting beside his pregnant wife in their home in Israel, as they watch news reports on television of the Munich Massacre. The newscaster reads aloud all eleven names of the Israeli athletes who were murdered. The world is shocked. Avner cannot look away from the television.</p>

                    <p>The next day, Avner is recruited by the Israeli Prime Minster to enlist for a top-secret mission with no end date. Avner can learn operational details only if he accepts the assignment blindly. Interestingly, Avner is neither a spy nor an intelligence operative. He has never taken a life. He may be gone for weeks, months, or even years. His main qualifications are that he is unknown to the enemy and that he possesses a deep love for Israel, which is his birthplace and home.</p>

                    <p>With a baby on the way, Avner hesitates, but he is unable to resist the siren call of his country. He will see the mission through, whatever it takes. To ensure nothing traces back to Israel, Avner is erased from all records. He heads to Europe as a ghost.</p>

                    <p>On the flight, he plays the Munich Massacre in his mind. Spielberg does not avoid the graphic nature of the violence. Avner imagines the armed terrorists assaulting the unarmed Israeli athletes, barging into their hostel, screaming, pointing, and firing their automatic weapons. Most sounds are silenced. The remaining sounds echo, which heightens their impact. John Williams’s theme plays over all of it, stirring our souls.</p>

                    <p>The brutality of the attack lingers, as it must. Spielberg repeatedly returns to the Munich Massacre through Avner’s imagination. In this initial sequence, Avner places his perspective with the Israeli athletes, who are bewildered and taken hostage. Some are murdered on sight. Avner’s mind provides the fuel for his mission and acts as a trauma processing zone. In some way, he has faith that killing the men responsible will help him find peace. Neither Avner nor we understand if the mission ahead will do.</p>

                    <p>When Avner lands, he bonds with the other four members of his ragtag team, who hail from different careers. One is a toymaker-turned-bomb-maker (Mathieu Kassovitz), another is the document-forger (Hanns Zischler), the third is the calm, clean-up man who erases operational evidence (Ciarán Hinds), and the last is a gun-for-hire (Daniel Craig). Together, they will try to assassinate eleven terrorists.</p>

                    <p>Avner traces down the first name on his list. He and the toymaker corner him in an empty hallway and pull out their weapons. The agents look at each other, unsure of the procedure. Avner asks the same question twice: <q>Are you Wael Zwaiter?</q> The toymaker interjects, <q>He already said yes.</q></p>
                    
                    <p>The target tries to deescalate the situation, by putting his shaking hand on Avner’s gun. Avner panics and fires. Both agents unload their weapons. As their bullet casings fall to the ground, so follows their target. Then, they rush out of the building together, sprinting in the streets back to their car. It is the first life taken in vengeance, but not the last.</p>

                    <p>To eliminate another name, Avner and team plan to blow up the mark’s bed in a hotel while the mark is asleep. Avner books the hotel room next door. To activate the bomb, Avner will turn off his bedside lamp. On the night of the operation, Avner waits on the balcony — only to find that the mark has come outside to smoke a cigarette.</p>

                    <p>The mark notices Avner and cannot place his country of origin. They exchange pleasantries over the newlyweds in the room over, who are rather noisy.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">The Mark: <q>They keep at it all night. For hours. Take a sleeping pill if you must. Do you have one?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Avner:  <q>No, no. Thank you very much.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">The Mark: <q>Really?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Avner: <q>Yes.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">The Mark: <q>So.... Good night. Pleasant dreams.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>As the mark lies down to sleep, Avner returns to his own bed. He stares at the lamp for a long time, as the cost of taking a life weighs on him. We do not hear his thoughts, but we imagine them: <q>Could such a man be a murderer? Do I truly believe that he involved in the Munich Massacre? I cannot know for certain. But if I shut this light, I will end his live. Is this what I should do?</q></p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>We watch him make a decision in the quiet, while the breeze blows in from the window. Spielberg holds the shot for about twenty seconds. In the moment, it feels excruciating. Avner turns off the light — and ends the man’s life.</p>

                    <p>As the list of names shrinks, the web of violence grows and the difficulty of success rises. New targets who weren’t involved in Munich need to be scoped into the mission. Operatives of different governments become involved. In one case, the C.I.A. successfully blocks the team’s plans to assassinate a very high-value target. The team’s anonymity is lost, as intel on their whereabouts become valuable. The five members of Avner’s team are now targets.</p>

                    <p>One by one, Avner’s team falls. On the night of their failed op, Avner finds his clean-up man slain in bed. In their collective rage, the team pauses their core mission to execute the assassin who killed their friend. They obtain intel about the location of her home.</p>

                    <p>But the toymaker refuses to accompany the team. Before they leave, he pulls Avner aside to say,</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>We were supposed to be righteous. That’s a beautiful thing.... And now, I’m losing it. That’s everything. That’s my soul.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Some time later, the toymaker commits suicide in the countryside, unable to bear the weight of his previous choices.</p>

                    <p>The remaining three find the assassin undressed in her home, and slay her. Avner covers her corpse with clothing, but the document-forger undoes his action. When the vendetta is over, their clarity reveals a contradiction: They killed an assassin whose job was to kill one of them. If the logic follows, what should happen to them?</p>

                    <p>Over dinner, the document-forger expresses regret at how he left her, wishing he could have offered her more dignity. The gun-for-hire tells him, <q>You weren’t yourself.</q></p>

                    <p>The forger does not reply, so his silence completes the conversation: <q>Maybe that is who I truly am.</q></p> 

                    <p>Sitting in between them, Avner recognizes how difficult taking a life used to be. Now, it is second-nature. His conscience grows louder: <q>Am I a just person anymore?</q></p>

                    <p>That night, Avner has nightmares of Munich Massacre, in which he vividly imagines more of the sequence, of hostages being taken to the airport. When he is awakened by the gun-for-hire, Avner points his gun at him. The forger is missing. The last two men search through the night, eventually discovering the document-forger’s cold body in a deserted park.</p>

                    <p>After Avner loses three team members, his paranoia peaks. The scope of the job only grows — and the collateral damage begins to weigh on him. For every team member slain, must we slay his assassin? For every new terrorist plotting another Munich, must we kill them, too?</p>

                    <p>These thoughts consume Avner. In a night of panic, he cuts open his mattress looking for a bomb and scans his hostel with a gun. Even when he finds no evidence of a bomb, he is too afraid to sleep in his bed. He takes his gun and lays on the closet floor. The threads are unraveling because the cumulative weight of violence has become too large for him.</p>

                    <p>At this point, Avner has one last job: To eliminate the mastermind of the Munich Massacre. At a crowded party on a gated property, he and the gun-for-hire attempt to assassinate him. Before they have a clean shot, they are discovered by a teenage patrol. We recognize this boy, who was orphaned by the team during an earlier operation. On that day, Avner saved his life. But on this day, Avner fires first, causing the boy’s instant death and revealing their location. Their operation is a failure. It is over.</p>

                    <p>Now, Avner ventures to Brooklyn, where he has asked his wife to move, fearing retribution on her life if she remained in Israel. One night, he sits by his daughter’s crib, holding a gun in his hands. There is an emotional distance between Avner and his wife, Daphna (Ayelet Zurer). She does not know what he has seen or done. Avner is not present in his family’s life yet. His mind is somewhere else. The mission is over, but it echoes in their relationship.</p>

                    <p>Munich is two hours, forty-four minutes — most of which is inordinately restrained. While we see the effects of violence on the team’s faces, there is little expressed in terms of guilt. Munich’s emotional threads are carried subconsciously, in the motivations of characters or by our mental connections, which creates a massive reserve of potential. Its final two scenes are carefully constructed to unleash this emotional power.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the film, Avner has revisited the trauma of the Munich Massacre in his mind, imagining events chronologically. By the second-to-last scene, we have not yet seen how most of the Israeli athletes were murdered.</p>

                    <p>In bed, Daphna sees Avner struggling to sleep, so she kisses him. The moment escalates between them. While Avner reciprocates his wife’s desire, he is not present during the act of romance. In this crucial moment, his imagination returns.</p>

                    <p>Avner sees the Israeli hostages and their Palestinian captors at the Munich airport. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/41wdqCdgBCHpKyUjEaSPfM">The cry of grief</a>, from the voice of Lisbeth Scott, is sonically forefront. The Israelis are seated in two helicopters on the tarmac, which have no pilots. Knowing there is no way out, the terrorists decide that they will not escape with the Israelis alive. They choose mass murder.</p>

                    <p>In the first helicopter, a terrorist unloads his weapon on the Israelis. Avner screams. Spielberg separates the violence from its typical presentation. Murder in Munich is not glorified, but nauseating and lingering.</p>

                    <p>Particularly in this vision, the emotional weight is magnified by sonic restraint: the traditional noises of bullets whizzing, automatic guns unloading, and blood spurting are never heard together. Sound designer Ben Burtt instead fills the soundstage with John Williams’s score and limits the sound effects to certain call-outs, which viscerally highlights them. You feel the immense loss of life.</p>

                    <p>But another helicopter of athletes remains. And there is no doubt what will happen next. As the next terrorist unloads his weapon, Avner screams, <q>NO!</q> He screams to save their lives, but also to purify his soul.</p>

                    <p>In the beginning, Avner does not question the directive of his government. He believes he is eliminating key members of an organization who either planned or performed the massacre.</p>

                    <p>Initially, Avner feels a sense of duty in wiping terrorists off the face of the Earth. But, he starts to resist the extrajudicial nature of his assassinations. Moreover, he is troubled by the lack of evidence provided for each name on his list. Is his government lying to him, by advancing other objectives in the name of justice?</p>

                    <p>When Avner leaves Europe, we must confront a stunning reversal: Avner’s actions tore holes in families, displacing children from their parents. We know he is a good man, tasked with a heavy burden. We have taken the time to understand his perspective, but we have not extended the same privileges to the men on the list. If any of the men that Avner killed was innocent, does that make him and his team terrorists? In the face of these questions, he cannot see his own righteousness anymore.</p>

                    <p>In his imagination, Avner is a helpless witness to the murder of eleven Israeli athletes. He can never change the outcome. I think he wonders: If the attack had never happened, if innocent lives were not brutally stolen, if I had responded to the violence differently, then I would never have had to sacrifice the integrity of my soul. Avner is powerless, a man caught in the cycle of violence, a pawn moved between unknown organizations, spy networks, and their nations.</p>

                    <p>Avner’s inner doubt subverts the most intimate act between spouses, exposing the depth of his scars. It is psychologically tormenting to witness a marriage that is unsafe from the trauma the husband carries as a soldier. By design, Avner And Daphna, the theme that John Williams wrote for the married couple, is tainted by the musical sounds that he used for the Munich Massacre. Avner thought he would find peace on his mission. Instead, Munich haunts him even more. How will he heal?</p>

                    <p>This is the climax of Munich, an emotional release of energy accumulated from one-hundred-fifty minutes of storytelling. It is a visceral sequence, that uses sound, music, and lighting to connect two unrelated places in time. It is haunting because it calls into question all we have seen. It cements what Munich is about: The story of an ordinary man who carries out an extraordinary duty to his nation. Was it worth it? Are the nation’s wounds tended to or left rotting? Will Avner ever make peace with his own trauma?</p>

                    <p>In Munich’s final scene, Avner speaks to Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), another Israeli Jew who has been Avner’s government liaison during the mission. Ephraim comes to Brooklyn to ask Avner to re-enlist. To assuage his conscience, Avner wants evidence that every man he killed was implicated in the Munich Massacre. After everything he’s been through, Avner distrusts Ephraim’s word.</p>
