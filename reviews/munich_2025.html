    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>The title of Steven Spielberg’s 2005 film, Munich, may appear generic, but it serves two purposes which make it effective. For one thing, it is an immediate reference to the film’s subject matter. Munich refers to the Munich Massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. In the film, the highest levels of the Israeli government authorize a team of agents to perform targeted assassinations on the eleven surviving terrorists, who either planned the attack or carried it out.</p>

                    <p>Secondly, after the film ends, we realize Munich is the source of all we have seen, encapsulated in one word. The signature achievement of Munich is how it constructs an emotional through-line from a single episode of violence to all subsequent events. Like ripples in a pond, the Munich Massacre sets off a cascading series of actions, which mires the team (and us) deeper and deeper into conflict and moral ambiguity.</p>

                    <p>How many lives must be taken to avenge the ones you lost? In our responses to violence, should we accept any compromises on the values of our nation? If so, where do we draw the line? And how do we hold it? By drawing us into the perspective of the team’s leader, Avner Kaufman, these are the questions that Spielberg forces us to reckon with.</p>

                    <p>As the team progresses further in their mission, they discover that they are in territory where there are no comforting answers. They are on the outskirts of civilized existence, ending lives under cover of darkness and surprise, where no laws or governments will protect them.</p>

                    <p>In some moments, members of the team feel an infection in their very souls. They ask each other: If we cannot save a civilian from collateral damage, do we call off that operation? And they silently question: Are these the men who were there that day? They are wrestling with a moral dilemma: In the words of Abraham Lincoln, must <q>every drop of blood drawn with the lash … be paid by another drawn with the sword?</q> When does the cycle of violence end? While Munich may focus on Israeli intelligence agents in the 1970s, its themes belong to the present as much as the past.</p>

                    <p>I come to Munich as an outsider. I am neither Israeli nor Palestinian, but I am very conscious of the deep feelings that exist. From the moment that Spielberg, an American Jew, announced his undertaking of such a project, criticism immediately followed. When the film was released, all sides found fault with the depictions of various groups and its factual basis. While he maintains that he has told this story truthfully, Spielberg is not making a documentary, embedded in the exact methods of spy-craft; other films serve that purpose. Spielberg’s highest goal is to immerse the audience in the story’s emotional truth.</p>

                    <p>Each act of violence in Munich is crucial to the story. To approach such heavy subject-matter, Spielberg uses his box of filmmaking tools differently. The look and feel of Munich is immediately recognizable, but it is how the story is presented that hooked me. Munich is not a condemnation or any other form of judgement; rather, it is a film that observes and passes questions to the audience. It is a different form of Spielberg’s filmmaking that <em>requires</em> audience participation. You must analyze your experience of watching the film. You must confront its questions. It is only then that Munich can be understood as Spielberg intends.</p>

                    <p>Odio euismod lacinia at quis risus sed vulputate odio. Justo nec ultrices dui sapien. Sodales ut etiam sit amet nisl purus. Malesuada pellentesque elit eget gravida cum sociis. Et tortor at risus viverra adipiscing. Sed cras ornare arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut. Tellus elementum sagittis vitae et leo duis ut diam. Nibh praesent tristique magna sit amet purus gravida. Nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat id porta nibh venenatis. Diam quis enim lobortis scelerisque fermentum dui faucibus. At risus viverra adipiscing at in tellus integer.</p>

                    <p>As most studio movies do, Munich opens on the participating studios’ logos. For a brief moment, it is silent. The string section fades in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0lJ3ws2j8KbAJL0iIf9fLw">And then, a woman’s voice pierces the soundscape</a>. She does not sing in Arabic nor Hebrew, but in words of her own creation. The sound is deliberately uncomfortable because it is a cry of pain. Grief is pouring out. Composer John Williams uses the voice of singer Lisbeth Scott to establish the tone of Munich and tell us immediately: In this story, you will be confronted by intense emotions. And you must decide for yourself, what is the proper response?</p>
