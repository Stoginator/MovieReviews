    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> is a film that demands a large tub of popcorn, an ICEE™, and a recliner. When its opening scene concluded, I knew I was in for a good time and a ton of fun. The momentum carried on — and I left the theater thinking, <q>That’s how you make a popcorn movie!</q></p>

                    <p>Audiences have endured a long road of sequels since 1993’s <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>, Steven Spielberg’s masterful adaptation of Michael Crichton’s sci-fi book, which balanced a “popcorn movie” tone with real ethical discussions. It changed Hollywood forever: unleashing digital visual effects that were believable, paving the way for blockbusters ever since. Spielberg returned to make 1997’s <cite>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</cite>, which he has publicly said was inferior to the original.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, many directors tried the same experiment and failed. 2015’s <cite>Jurassic World</cite> introduced a new central cast of characters within the same universe and began a trilogy released across seven years. Unfortunately, each film became progressively worse — bloated, uninteresting, CGI-filled stories. Sometimes, the dinosaurs weren't the main attraction. I left this series with bad memories.</p>

                    <p>Against historical precedent (<em>five mediocre or horrendous sequels in a row!</em>), director Gareth Edwards has made the best sequel since <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>. Edwards has carved his own niche in Hollywood as a director who delivers CGI-heavy, sci-fi material under-budget and on-time. He revived the nuclear-powered sea monster in 2014’s <cite>Godzilla</cite>, made the best <cite>Star Wars</cite> film of the last decade in 2016’s <cite>Rogue One</cite>, and opined on our potential relationships with humanoid-A.I. beings in <a href="https://www.tanishsmoviereviews.com/reviews/the_creator_2023.html">2023’s <cite>The Creator</cite></a>. To resuscitate the <cite>Jurassic</cite> franchise on-time and under-budget, he was Universal Pictures’ pick.</p>

                    <p>It helps that David Koepp, the writer of the original, has returned to pen this iteration. Koepp revisited each entry and created nine commandments: official trade secrets of Universal Pictures that are locked behind vault and key. Armed with them, he has crafted a compelling reason to give this series another chance.</p>

                    <p>Consider this ethical dilemma that connects real-world issues and the fictional story world: A pharmaceutical company asks you to illegally venture to dinosaur island to extract samples from three mega-dinosaurs. The samples are the last pieces of a drug that can cure heart disease. Would you risk your life to enrich a pharmaceutical company, but also save millions of lives? With action, great actors, and some popcorn, I was locked to my seat.</p>

                    <p>Against series convention, <cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> has a stacked cast with known actors in most of the roles. The filmmakers knew they needed help: The story was good, but each character’s name was extremely forgettable. So, the faces needed to be memorable.</p>

                    <p>This is a heist movie, disguised as a sci-fi action-adventure. A pharmaceutical executive (Rupert Friend) is putting together a team. First, he hires Zora (Scarlett Johansson), the best mercenary in the world. They need someone who can identify the three dinosaurs needed, so they find a paleontologist, Dr. Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey). Zora needs more firepower, so she recruits Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali), a fellow mercenary. The heist begins, with all of the surprises and knots along the way.</p>

                    <p>And what a return to form! Edwards is one of the few directors with an eye for compositing, the step where digital visual effects are blended with captured footage of actors or locations. His shots look natural, immersing us in the story, without the distraction of thinking, “That dinosaur looks fake!” The frame in <cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> is loaded with details but never overwhelms. Surprises lurk in the corners or in plain-sight, camouflaged as they would be on a real, tropical island or even in a city.</p>

                    <p>Edwards has studied the history of the franchise and is one of Steven Spielberg’s biggest fans. He opted to shoot <cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> on film, not digital. This is more expensive and time-consuming than an all digital workflow, but the final result connects to the visual language of the original. The largest intangible about <cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> is how familiar, yet fresh it feels. In terms of restoring audience goodwill, that is unquantifiable.</p>

                    <p>References to the previous entries are embedded in the script and visuals. There is a Crichton Middle School, a direct allusion to Dr. Alan Grant, and blood dripping from above like what happens to the poor soldier in <cite>Jurassic World</cite>. Edwards uses John Williams’s original theme, going full-bore at the right time in a way that gave me goosebumps.</p>

                    <p>The ending left me perplexed on what is to come. I hope the next writer will use Koepp’s Nine Commandments of a <cite>Jurassic Park</cite> Film to draft a new story. Officially, he has only released three:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Embrace science as much as possible.</li>
                        <li>Keep continuity with past films.</li>
                        <li>Be funny (i.e., characters should understate the crazy situation they are in).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here are my six to finish up his list:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Respect the dinosaurs (i.e., awe-inspiring creatures who are central to the plot and never the villain).</li>
                        <li>Feature children in danger, but also helping save the day.</li>
                        <li>Nature is king — and the characters must accept this idea by picture close (e.g., the birds flying next to the helicopter in <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>).</li>
                        <li>Challenge the audience with an ethical dilemma (e.g., Should we have brought back dinosaurs? Should we help a greedy pharmaceutical rep to save lives?).</li>
                        <li>Return to Michael Crichton’s source material as a Bible.</li>
                        <li>A T-Rex must make an appearance!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>While my six are likely different from Koepp’s list, the North Star has been developed. A great sequel has to do more than simply fulfill the commandments. It must have great plotting, likable characters, and sound visual construction. <cite>Jurassic World: Rebirth</cite> does all of these things, which is why it felt like an authentic successor to <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>.</p>
