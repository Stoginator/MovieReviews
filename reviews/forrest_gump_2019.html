    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>There’s no question that <cite>Forrest Gump</cite> is an American classic. If you try to think of culturally significant films over the past twenty five years, this surely rises to the top. It does what movies do best: take you into another life to experience moments of poignancy and exhilaration. And, even the subject matter is incredibly epic. It is a love story between two people placed into the middle of the most important events of the mid-twentieth century. </p>

                    <p>The film begins with a feather blowing in the air, shifting directions with the breeze and by chance, landing on the titular character’s muddy Nike shoes. We meet Forrest Gump - an innocent, sensitive, and authentic man. He guides us through his life beginning in his childhood when he had leg braces. As with every challenge that Forrest had, he ran, broke through them, and never needed them again. That’s a metaphor for his personality; Forrest grows on the audience and allows us to empathize with his journey (which is also due to Tom Hanks’ perfect performance). Forrest’s values never change over the course of the film, but those around him are sucked into the world of chaos. He’s grounded in people, never succumbing to the worst human instincts of greed, cowardice, and conformity. I think that’s why we love him, simply because he is Forrest.</p>

                    <p><cite>Forrest Gump</cite> operates on an elevated plane in terms of film. It tells the personal story of the titular character on an enormous scale. It weaves the themes of history into his tale: the cruelty of segregation, the effects of war, the thirst for vengeance. It contrasts with Forrest’s primary instinct of decency; Forrest is the face of our nation’s “better angels”. But, even though this is at the forefront for much of the movie’s runtime, all of if feels peripheral. The one throughline is Forrest and his girl, Jenny. Childhood love birds. They spent every second together until Jenny went off to college. Forrest did not understand why Jenny could not be with him. His unrequited love was of the purest form, but Jenny’s past haunted her present. Jenny knew Forrest was too good for her until she confronted her demons. This human thread keeps the story grounded and provides the emotional backbone for the audience. Even considering his numerous moments of glory, Forrest’s love for Jenny takes him down the toughest and most rewarding path in life. Everybody can learn something from Forrest. The character is just so damn entertaining to watch and follow through his times of exhilaration, displays of love, and good-byes. </p>

                    <p>Initially, we are led to believe that we are introduced to Forrest Gump by chance, but we slowly learn this is not the case. One of Forrest’s “best good“ friends is Lieutenant Dan. Forrest saves him from certain death in the jungle of Vietnam and leaves him alive, but without legs. He accuses Forrest of altering his destiny which was originally to die with honor on the battlefield. <q>I don’t know if we each have a destiny, or if we’re all floating around accidental-like on a breeze,</q> Forrest says. It is an existential question that forces you to reflect on Forrest’s life and wonder how he got to the end. Forrest never floated with the breeze; every decision he made was consciously his own. The film leaves the subject ambiguously, but afterwards, you move on and consider your own life. That’s movie magic.</p>

                    <p>Forrest Gump feels like a window into another life. It is so true to its characters, so accurate in placing the audience in history, and so graceful in presenting the story with sensitivity. As the end credits rolled, I needed some time to reflect on the journey. This one was profound in its balance of intimacy and scale. It is unique in the annals of cinema.</p>

                    <p>My English teachers told me never to do this, but in the words of Forrest Gump, “That’s all I have to say about that.”</p>
