    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>1967’s <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> was a revolutionary premise thrown into the most mainstream of movies. Triple-headed by a lights-out, all-star ensemble, the creative forces behind <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> were interested to tackle one of the thorniest propositions in America at the time: interracial marriage. The studio was loath to fund it, feeling afraid that it went further than American audiences would find acceptable. With a multi-picture deal with Columbia Pictures, director Stanley Kramer pushed through studio opposition to get this film made, deferring his paycheck for the entirety of production. The result: a fascinating, funny, and essential dramatic narrative that dually functions as an historical exhibit of an American moment – that also grossed fourteen times what it cost at the box office. Who says great films can’t be popular, too?</p>

                    <p>In 1967, with the recent passage of President Johnson’s Great Society bills, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Acts of 1965, and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the racial landscape of America was set for rapid change. Discrimination on the basis of race was illegal – and enforced throughout the nation for the first time. Before these laws, equality under the law was an ideal and a promise kept only in the best of times, but now, rubber was about to meet the road. How would Americans of all races react to the great forces of social change that were incoming? <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> brings home an issue that four parents never imagined they would deal with in such a personal way.</p>

                    <p>Any discussion of <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> must start with the casting. An off-screen couple, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn play husband and wife in the film. It is motion picture lore that Tracy was sick throughout production but insisted on finishing the part. Tracy, the man who Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and Clark Cable called the best of their generation, passed away before the film released. <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> became his final, posthumous role – and the most stirring performance in the film. His eight-minute monologue that serves as the story climax is the stuff of legend.</p>

                    <p>Twenty-three-year-old Joanna Drayton (Katherine Houghton) brings home John Prentice, played by Sidney Poitier who had a year for the ages. In 1967, Poitier also starred in <cite>To Sir, With Love</cite> and <cite>In the Heat of the Night</cite>. All three films were box office hits; all three dove into commentary about Poitier’s race. Poitier was the exceptional American trailblazer whose artistic endeavors challenged the mainstream conceptions of the public.</p>

                    <p><cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> is not a melodramatic film nor an irrational one. No character’s reactions to the new couple coming home struck me as over-the-top. Every character’s feelings about the matter felt realistic. Moreover, the sum of emotions from all the characters captures every perspective that someone in America at the time could have about this peculiar union. The film refuses to reduce the issues of race relations; there is no “Kumbaya” moment to be found here.</p>

                    <p>I have read complaints that John’s excellent education and resumé are <em>classist</em>. If John had been less eminently qualified as a travelling doctor, then the Drayton family would be less willing to accept the marriage. Sure, but I see it as an essential matter of dramatic necessity. It removes potential excuses from the Draytons – and narrows the real issue down to “the pigmentation problem.” Just the same, the Drayton family’s wealth, living in a posh home in a nice neighborhood, certainly removes a few excuses from the Prentice family.</p>

                    <p>Tracy’s character, Mr. Drayton, was also a play on expectations. In his character, we have a liberal newspaper editor, a supporter of the civil rights movement. Even for someone like him, the fruit of what he so vehemently argued for shocks him into a moral stupor. He is not the stereotypical racist I thought I would see – far from it. Of course, history rhymes: today, we see those who preach for an assortment of causes, only to fight the same causes when they arrive close to home. Today, it is called <em>NIMBYism</em>, Not In My Back Yard.</p>

                    <p>The only way I can describe the early sensitivity of John and Joanna is, sometimes, they felt like kids caught by the school principal after a naughty deed. That quickly changes for these characters – who realize, in the relationships with their own parents, if they have to face the open road alone, then they will. John’s impassioned moment with his father shared a perspective I have never before heard – in a film or anywhere else. These spontaneous and frank conversations between different pairings of characters elevate this film above what could have been stereotypical melodrama.</p>

                    <p>In addition, I was surprised by the strong presence of Frank DeVol’s wonderful score. In moments of internal transformation for the characters, it overwhelms us. The particular moment that comes to mind is Katherine Hepburn’s solo scene on the patio, viewing the unobstructed San Francisco sunset as tears begin to flow. We cannot read her mind, but it feels like we can: I want my daughter to be as happy as the world allows. Any mother would want this, husbands be damned.</p>

                    <p>I loved the number of meanings that <cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> has after the initial one we expected: parents, a best friend, a prejudiced friend. There are always surprises about who is at the door of the Drayton family’s house. It reminded me of 2018’s <cite>Green Book</cite>, when the audience wants Doctor Shirley to arrive at Tony Lipp’s home, but it does not happen in the way we expect. When we expect John’s parents to arrive, we are surprised to see Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway) instead. These moments were spiritual predecessors.</p>

                    <p><cite>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</cite> does what movies can do best. When people from all backgrounds came to see this film in the movie theater, it surely ruffled some feathers. There were probably people screaming at the screen, the “one hundred million people” who are disapproving of an interracial union. Fifty-seven years later and three generations further, even the nonplussed reaction of audiences back then – as Katherine Hepburn’s character emulates – feels strange. Now, we take for granted what so many could not.</p>

                    <p>As their once-obstinate mothers witness John and Joanne’s love, the film inevitably softened many hearts to what would become an eventuality for every family in America – either in this generation or the next. If you never considered the possibility, you surely did now! And, maybe after watching Spencer, Sidney, and the Katherines, just maybe you didn’t mind it. The kids are gonna be kids. At the end of the line, who are we if we stood in the way of dreams?</p>
