    				<p><cite>The Tree of Life</cite> is the first of Terrence Malick's films that I have had the opportunity to see. While more abstract and ambiguous compared to "normal" linear movies, it carries greater weight because of the various interpretations that arise.</p>

                    <p>The Tree of Life doesn't take place in a single setting, but it mainly stays in a suburban area in the presumed 1950s. The story centers on Jack, a man (acted by Sean Penn) that has flashbacks to his childhood family when the worst news arrives. His brother is dead. </q> </p>

                    <p>The film then flashes back even further to the beginning of time as we know it - The Big Bang. I assume this is to show the nature of God and his timelessness through all of existence. But, it can also be, from a scientific perspective, the birth of Earth that gave rise to mankind - and to a lesser degree, religion which plays a gargantuan role in Jack's family.</p>

                    <p>Jack's Mother, played by Jessica Chastain, wants her children to be free, to embrace their youthfulness without the pressures of the world on their shoulders, but she wants them disciplined in some way. Jack's Father is taken on by Brad Pitt who is a rugged disciplinarian with anger channeled from his own mistakes that he needs to have extended onto his children. <q>Don't do like I did, promise me that</q>, he says.</p>

                    <p>Terrence Malick must have had an extremely difficult time with picking the elements that most represents humanity and differentiating us from the rest of space. Because of the extended timeline of the entire universe, Mr. Malick decides to focus on three principles aspects of all life: religion (and the lack thereof), nature, and love.</p>

                    <p>For Jack, Mother and Father imbed a strong religiosity in him that also pervades the entire film. It is apparent in the music (by Alexandre Desplat - 2011 what a year for him) with the choir and the organ. He asks question: if God is all good, why does he let bad things happen? He takes it upon himself to emulate God as he sees him.</p>

                    <p>With the camera, Emmanuel Lubezki captures the beginning of time in truly spectacular fashion with a combination of CGI and real, practical effects. Mr. Malick shows us a visualization of God and then we see the Big Bang, volcanoes form the Earth, dinosaurs roam it, and the meteorite that ended them. From there, into modern times, is Jack's birth and his toddlerhood.</p>

                    <p>Beautifully captured, Mr. Malick and Mr. Lubezki have all the great moments - first steps, first words, baptism, and lots of playing. Then, Jack turns 12 and begins to simultaneously embrace and question his world, which manifests into God, his Father, and himself. </p>

                    <p>Older Jack had gone through his memories and begins a catharsis unto, what the film depicts, as the end of Earth and for humans, the end of time.</p>

                    <p>The Tree of Life is a very articulate film, that speaks through imagery and implications of it that would not work in dialogue and are more profound when left to the mind. Things like visualizing God are better left unspoken, and in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, they are.</p>
