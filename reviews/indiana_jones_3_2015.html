                    <p>Out of the thirty-plus Spielberg-Williams collaborations, 1989’s <cite>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</cite> may have the best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjiwSk1S0Ls&pp=ygUTbGFzdCBjcnVzYWRlIG9wZWluZw%3D%3D">opening scene</a> of all. A mysterious aura lures the audience into distant tracking shots of men on horses. We wonder: what treasure do they seek? Spielberg’s love of 1956’s <cite>The Searchers</cite> bleeds into picture as Monument Valley provides a wonderful backdrop. Approaching Arches National Park (which is hours away from Monument Valley), the group stops their trek and dismounts. But wait! These are only kids. Boy Scouts!</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“It belongs in a museum!”</blockquote>

                    <p>We are introduced to a young Indiana, played by the late River Phoenix, vying for a precious crucifixion cross discovered by Coronado (who no one knows). He attracts the attention of a group of bounty hunters who pursue him onto a train. During this remarkable chase on the carriages containing traveling zoo animals, Indiana is forged into the hero we recognize, complete with his creativity, his fear of snakes, and his weapon of choice in a whip. He escapes to fight another day, or so we think. Initially, the leader of the bounty hunters (Richard Young) is annoyed that he could not catch this kid, but his irritation transforms into a smile.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Upon arriving home, Indiana impatiently summons his father, who forces him to wait. The town sheriff arrives, demanding that Indiana return the cross to its “rightful” owner. Defeated by a bunch of goons, Indiana seems shocked by the result. Placing the famous brown fedora atop Indiana’s head, the leader says:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"You lost today, kid, but that doesn’t mean you have to like it.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The opening chase is among the most memorable of not just the film, but the whole series. However, the dynamic that makes <cite>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</cite> so rewatchable is the emotional arc of the film, played out between Indiana (Harrison Ford) and his father, Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery). The pair are a father and son who fail to understand each other: a son who believes his father was absent and inattentive to his needs and a father who believes in teaching “self-reliance.” In another way, here are two of the biggest box-office-draws of the twentieth century side-by-side. Harrison Ford, the steward of Han Solo, Rick Deckard, and Indiana Jones, next to Sean Connery, the man who portrayed the character that Indiana had sprouted from, James Bond.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>It is cinematic lore that Spielberg always wanted to direct a James Bond film, but the producers believed he was too young. After the commercial and critical failure of his newest film 1941, an oft-forgotten World War II comedy from 1979, Spielberg was despondent in the world’s paradise of Hawaii. To lure his friend out of a depression, George Lucas pitched him the character of Indiana Jones, built in with the same duality of James Bond. A globe-trotting cowboy who is also a professor; an archaeologist with the charm of a tuxedo-ed spy; a fearless adventurer who is deathly afraid of snakes.</p>

                    <p>To place (and somehow sign) the two actors next to each other was a stroke of genius. Spielberg, Ford, and Lucas must have been overjoyed to work with their idol – and their creative output did not disappoint. Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam created some terrific scenes between father and son upon which the entire film hinges. The misunderstandings that pervade the two’s relationship are foreshadowed in their <a href="https://youtu.be/b1wo7AtqX7s?si=JzPaNGY3YRE9b3mn&t=47">very first scene</a> together when Henry Jones Sr. (Dr. Jones) breaks a Chinese vase on Indiana’s head.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">
                        Dr. Jones: “Late 14th Ming Dynasty. Oh, it breaks the heart.”<br>
                        Indiana: “And the head. You hit me, Dad.”<br>
                        Dr. Jones: “I'll never forgive myself.”<br>
                        Indiana: “Don't worry. I'm fine.”<br>
                        Dr. Jones: “Thank God... it's fake. See, you can tell with the cross sections.”<br>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>On a series of escapades, the bigger misunderstandings from the past begin to boil up as they are being hunted by Nazis. Each chase is more entertaining than the last because the story beats within them progress their dynamic, too.</p>

                    <p>In the beat above, consider Mr. Jones’ disappointment with his son. The pressure of the moment brings out Dr. Jones’s discontent of having to run from the Nazis in the first place! After Indiana humorously takes care of business, they start to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/e1KKVy-nki8?si=TtkkDJfBcuGUYnbU&t=315">mission priorities</a>: Dr. Jones’s preference to track the diary into Berlin or Indiana’s preference to find their friend, Marcus, with the map. Indiana felt abandoned by his father, who Indiana felt coveted his obsessions with artifacts like the Holy Grail more than him.</p>

All this happens while they are being hunted by the Nazis. Their disagreement is not resolved until the unfathomable occurs: Dr. Jones believes he has lost his son, Indiana. </p>
                    <p>In that moment, Dr. Jones understands the truth: the past must be put aside and left behind. Such petty arguments do not matter in the grand scheme of things. In Sean Connery’s performance, you visibly see that the abrasiveness, the coldness, and the disappointment all disappear. The two share a long hug that is emotionally earned. Now, we see that Dr. Jones has never been more excited to share an adventure with his son, yelling at him,</p>

                    <p>In a few words, Dr. Jones undoes the years of obsession over the Holy Grail. Under the greatest of pressure with the Holy Grail within Indiana’s reach, he asks his son to leave it behind. In five words, Dr. Jones tells Indiana that he matters to him more than his life’s work, validating his son in a way that only a loving father can do. In lesser words, Dr. Jones says, “You are enough for me, son.” In 1989, you can be sure that, with John William’s horns and orchestra swelling around the audience, tears were falling in every auditorium. The emotional arc is the most satisfying in the series, and true of many, many films: out of misunderstanding comes love.</p>

    				<p>Witnessing some of the great actions set-pieces of our time, this movie is second ONLY to <cite>Raiders of the Lost Ark</cite>. How can one expect another movie to surpass that kind of greatness? Also, it doesn't mean in any way that <cite>Last Crusade</cite> is less impressive.</p>

                    <p>Starting with a bombastic teenage flashback where Indy tries to rob a Christian cross antique from some goons, the movies kicks off with its flashing pace. This is how Indiana Jones movies were meant to be. Only Spielberg could combine such spectacle, scale, and nostalgia into one sequence. Indy jumps onto to a circus train filled with animals of all phylums. There, he recognizes every part of who he will become in his adulthood. Ingenious.</p>

                    <p>The Holy Grail is what Indy is looking out to find in this flick, and this was his father's life work (spending 40 years on the topic!). When he is reunited with his father (acted out by the one and only Sean Connery), Indy stumbles. Their chemistry takes up the screen and most of it is quite hilarious and very unexpected. </p>

                    <p>While no one can praise the action enough, the music also fits this category. Bewildering, loud, and grand (did I mention reminiscent), John Williams conducts a shadow on other scores. But, Williams needs no introduction and neither will his music.</p>

                    <p>The <cite>Last Crusade</cite> was a finale that ends all and takes home all. See it. This one just hit the ball out of the park.</p>
