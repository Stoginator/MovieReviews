    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>I first saw <cite>The Dark Knight</cite> in 2009 in a mini-van when the DVD was loaded into to a player and I watched the movie on a 10 inch screen. Lord, the shame I feel viewing a far-superior movie directed by Christopher Nolan on 10-inches when traditional IMAXs are 80 feet. Sad.</p>

                    <p>To date, <cite>The Dark Knight</cite> is a virtuosic take on Batman and is so unrelentingly good that I may have missed some beats in awe. Taking place in Gotham City, Batman, or by his other alias, Bruce Wayne, meets a sadistic man whose character is so ... damn perfect. Known as the Joker, he plans to seize control of Gotham whilst pushing Wayne to analyze his limits.</p>

                    <p>Nolan's on the top of his game here producing a realistic, graphic, suspenseful, and grounded thriller that has pushed this out of superhero territory and into the "greatest movies ever" category. The movie starts off with a bank heist that is exceptionally executed and with IMAX cameras adding to the quality. The movie shines not only as the first blockbuster to be shot on IMAX, but as one that is mindful and thought-out as well.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Dark Knight</cite> has a story with of unpredictable twists, due only to the Joker. Nolan has quite a part written for Mister Heath Ledger whose performance stands among the greats. His motives and dialogue are an examination of psychopaths and it is one of the places where this film shines the brightest.</p>

                    <p>But the film is not so bright, this is also a story of a city gone to hell, a literal hell. Joker terrorizes this city to its breaking point and causes Bruce Wayne to confront  his inner conflicts. He must decide where enough is enough and who he wants to be. Because of the Joker, the presumed good-side of the Gotham City Police and Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, are a striking contrast to the Joker's mad tactics, and his motives only exemplify that contrast which towards the end blurs significantly.</p>

                    <p>At one point, the Joker explains that he isn't one with a plan. That the others are schemers and planning all-day. But, oh is he quite the trickster. The story unfolds because of his plan, and it is quite a stand-out how of smart the Joker really is.</p>

                    <p>Analyzing the Joker is a very interesting game, he looks at life different than most and his mind is warped from his past experiences. He believes that he is what humanity truly is "deep down" and has learned everything through pain.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"When the chips are down, these ... civilized people ... they'll eat each other." - The Joker</blockquote>

                    <p>The Joker has become hardened into a heartless, brutal, and ruthless person. But, Nolan comes out in a stroke of genius and reveals that he isn't truly crazy by revealing his motives, but don't fall for it.</p>

                    <p>The film even shows the effect the Joker has on regular citizens, the ones like you and me. It shows what normal people would do when pitted against each other, but Batman proves that Joker isn't "ahead of the curve", he is just a mad dog set off his leech. The movie also represents what a win "feels" like in these situations. It is never completely a win and debates could be had over whether Batman truly won or whether the Joker was "ahead of the curve" or plain crazy.</p>

                    <p>This movie also represents a wholly new chapter for Bruce Wayne. Fighting Batman, Bruce has lost who his individual identity and has literally become Batman, and the Joker pushes him to his boundaries and also of the ones around him. This is a central plot point that all characters notice, even a child at one point, and is one of the most interesting inner conflicts I have ever seen put on screen.</p>

                    <p>Nolan is also unforgiving about what he puts on screen. He doesn't seem to mind showing Joker as he turns more and more warped as the movie progresses. Burning a 15 foot tall pyramid of one-hundred dollar bills, firing rockets in a city tunnel, Nolan produces some great stunts with this movie, too. But, Batman also seems more indecisive about what he is to do, until the answer is shown in black and white. It seems Batman lacks the grounded-ness the Joker has to his character. Batman and Bruce don't know themselves as well as the Joker does himself (or thinks he does).</p>

                    <p>In the end, the Joker is too gifted and lives up to his reputation. He beats Dent and Batman. But, the Joker cannot win. And, Batman makes the ultimate sacrifice. The Joker is perhaps the single greatest antagonist ever and it is extremely easy to forget that this is a superhero movie because of its dark, dark take on the real world. Nolan has created a timeless movie that will forever be remembered as breathless examination on a city where everything goes to hell.</p>
