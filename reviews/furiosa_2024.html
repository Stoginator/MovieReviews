    				<p>Many great film series are based on books: <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>, <cite>Harry Potter</cite>, and <cite>Dune</cite>. Even fewer series are original films, whose genesis can be credited to a single, imaginative filmmaker: George Lucas’ <cite>Star Wars</cite>, James Cameron’s <cite>Avatar</cite>, and George Miller’s <cite>Mad Max</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Furiosa provides back story in the <cite>Mad Max</cite> world, explaining how the character we met in 2015’s <cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite> became its fiercest survivor. By their very nature, prequels are precarious stories to tell. How do you create dramatic tension and propel the audience through a journey when the destination is already known?</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Played by Charlize Theron in <cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite> and replaced by Anya Taylor-Joy in this film, Furiosa is an interesting mystery. After nuclear war reduces Australia to a desert-swept Wasteland, how did a child, born into a new hell on Earth, endure? That is one of the dramatic questions of <cite>Furiosa</cite>. Because we know this film cannot end with her death, it needs a replacement: how do the pressures of the Wasteland change her? Can she maintain her humanity in the face of enormous cruelty?</p>

                    <p>George Miller is one of the cinema’s visual masters. The images he produces are indelible and his style is immediately recognizable. Like previous entries in his fifty-five-year-old series, he keeps the series DNA intact: <cite>Furiosa</cite> is incredibly heavy on vehicle-based action. Again and again, he continues his use of a fluid camera, one that violently moves into and out of cars. His use of fabulous orange color in the Wasteland subverts our expectations of how the end of times is supposed to appear.</p>

                    <p><cite>Furiosa</cite>’s opening sequence is terrific, showing us the forge of cruelty that led her into the Wasteland. Far from a dispassionate experience, the beginning of <cite>Furiosa</cite> has an air of emotion that is unavoidable. What Furiosa cares about is quickly taken away – as is destiny in the Wasteland. However, the stakes of this picture fall apart and <cite>Furiosa</cite> loses its momentum.</p>

                    <p>Odio euismod lacinia at quis risus sed vulputate odio. Justo nec ultrices dui sapien. Sodales ut etiam sit amet nisl purus. Malesuada pellentesque elit eget gravida cum sociis. Et tortor at risus viverra adipiscing. Sed cras ornare arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut. Tellus elementum sagittis vitae et leo duis ut diam. Nibh praesent tristique magna sit amet purus gravida. Nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat id porta nibh venenatis. Diam quis enim lobortis scelerisque fermentum dui faucibus. At risus viverra adipiscing at in tellus integer.</p>

                    <p>The contract that the film’s title makes is broken. Too often, Furiosa is not the subject of her own movie. What follows feels more like the worst excesses of franchise filmmaking: fan service. Instead of challenging the audience with new directions, screentime is given to familiar characters and places – whose story has already been satisfactorily told.</p>

                    <p>Then, the habituation begins: we see a tremendous amount of vehicular action, acts of cruelty, and hear deafening noises. I found myself drearily watching car chases and public executions that overstay their welcome. <cite>Furiosa</cite> has the narrative feel of a mid-film flashback, a memory that has been stretched out into a one-hundred-and-forty-minute action drama.</p>

                    <p><cite>Furiosa</cite> was held back by its roots as a prequel. When you must reuse characters rather than start fresh, it is hard to create tension or original moments. The pace of the film begins to drag. Moments of fan service can flesh out the colors of a world, but they can quickly dull a film. Sometimes, taking the scenic route in a story breaks a cardinal, unspoken rule: The material that consumes screen time should be essential to the story. After the first act, I never felt the stakes of this story. What more can you take away from Furiosa?</p>

                    <p>The opening sequence of <cite>Furiosa</cite> sets up another stirring, dramatic question: Will Furiosa find her home again? But <cite>Furiosa</cite> cannot satisfactorily resolve this main conflict because the question has already been answered in <cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite>. In five minutes of <cite>Fury Road</cite>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieJUpjmyx-E&pp=ygUebWFkIG1heCBmdXJ5IHJvYWQgZnVyaW9zYSBob21l">Furiosa discovers what happened to her home</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Given the limitations of Miller’s story in <cite>Furiosa</cite>, he surely did as well as could be expected, but it feels like two-hundred-million dollars were spent to explain a five-minute scene. Newcomers, who are unfamiliar with <cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite>, will leave the theater frustrated and jaded as Miller expects the audience to already know the answer to what Furiosa desires. This is a huge reason that Furiosa was unable to expand its audience beyond existing <cite>Mad Max</cite> fans and why it has been relegated to flop status at the box office.</p>

                    <p>Furiosa’s chief baddie, Dementus the Great, is a small-time warlord commanding a gang of bikers. The creative team had to dull Chris Hemsworth’s physical appearance with an obvious prosthetic nose that was supposed to be scary, but always looks off. Hemsworth can only provide one edge to this bad guy: a teddy bear that hangs from his pelvis. Dementus mentions the toy a few times making us wonder how his family was taken from him, but it is difficult to look past how he murders, steals, enslaves non-followers for more power.</p>

                    <p>Dementus takes something precious away from Furiosa and begins a revenge plot. Furiosa will never forget what he did. However, the repercussions of this crucial moment are sidelined for a detour through inessential territory. When the revenge plot finally returns at the end of the film, its resolution is captured entirely in dialogue, not through a series of images. This felt anti-climactic as it breaks away from the visual storytelling that Miller does best. The ending of <cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite> was unspoken; all the mutual respect and trust between two fierce warriors is captured in glances of recognition between Furiosa and Max. Unfortunately, <cite>Furiosa</cite> did not have a Junkie XL track like <cite>Let Them Up</cite> to end the film.</p>
                    
                    <p>I try to watch movies in the theaters - and I tend to enjoy the previews before a film. However, the marketing team behind <cite>Furiosa</cite> placed the most spectacular frames and key dialogue into its trailers and TV spots. Sadly, many surprises that would have elevated the film were ruined. Movie trailers are an art, but when used recklessly like this, they cannibalize the experience. I want to enjoy a film’s climax at the proper moment, not in a two-minute preview. (This phenomenon has been common this year with <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, <cite>Civil War</cite>, <cite>The Fall Guy</cite>, and <cite>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</cite> all prematurely broadcasting footage from the climax in the marketing.) The more control filmmakers have over the marketing, the better.</p>
                    
                    <p>I was unimpressed by the sound mix. I expected chest-rattling motorcycle-revving but received ear-piercing highs. In an IMAX theater, <cite>Furiosa</cite> unhealthily eclipsed 95 to 100 decibels multiple times according to my digital watch. It dominated the higher ranges of sound instead of having its vehicles produce bass that hits your chest.</p>

                    <p><cite>Mad Max: Fury Road</cite> has its share of trauma, but it moves quickly to remain enjoyable. The action was chaotic, but always fun. Furiosa spends much of its time dwelling on traumatic situations without finding much meaning in many of them. We get it: The Wasteland is a cruel place. What else can be said? While Furiosa will not die in a prequel, her poor predicaments can still make us squeal.</p>
                    
                    <p><cite>Furiosa</cite> is an emotionally rich, but ultimately unsatisfying ride. Its status as a prequel held back its potential - as so much of the story had already been told. The chief lesson of the Wasteland is that civilization is a fragile structure. Without its bearings, humanity succumbs to its darker nature: We will enslave, torture, and kill each other to endure. Furiosa could have headed down the same path as those around her. She could have been a supreme warlord. Instead, she chooses another path, a distant one from the median of human behavior in the Wasteland.</p>

                    <p>Like all characters of this world, her fate is immutably sealed from birth. All paths lead to the Wasteland. The question is: Who do you become when you get there?</p>
