    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>For over 50 years, it was accepted that World War II was won because of spectacular Allied decisions that compromised the Axis Powers, but until recently the general public had been told the wrong reasons for how these decisions came about.</p>

                    <p>Alan Turing was a truly brilliant mathematician who, with a team of codebreakers, decrypted the Enigma Code developed and used by Nazi forces. The Code was employed by the Nazis for all important communications - to break it was to essentially be able to counteract Germany before they took action. If it were not for Turing, an estimated 14 million more people would have died and the war would have lasted two more years.</p>

                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit ut aliquam. Orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc non blandit. Velit scelerisque in dictum non consectetur a erat. Et leo duis ut diam quam. Cursus mattis molestie a iaculis at erat. Sed elementum tempus egestas sed sed risus pretium quam vulputate. Nisl pretium fusce id velit ut tortor pretium viverra suspendisse. Duis ut diam quam nulla porttitor massa. Scelerisque fermentum dui faucibus in ornare quam viverra. In iaculis nunc sed augue lacus viverra vitae congue.</p>

                    <p>In the film, Turing is played by the magnificent Benedict Cumberbatch who, even though he has to play an eccentric, slightly arrogant man, stretches his theatrical wings. Cumberbatch depicts Turing as a vulnerable, yet cocky, but brilliant young man. His story is one of great fortune, and despairing misfortune. You might think that the film's main purpose is the World War that envelops the film's time frame, but the director, Morten Tyldum, and the film's screenwriter, Graham Moore, simply have to shift the focus from history ever so slightly to reveal that Turing is the film's attraction.</p>

                    <p>As a 15 year old, it is hard for me to look into the past to see the power of political and social changes. Back in the 20th century, homosexuality was a crime of indecency, and over 49,000 people were accused. Alan Turing was one of those people. He was forced to either prison or government-induced therapy to cure him of his homosexuality. Rather than face prison and have his work and life condescended upon or even condemned, he took the treatment and after a year of psychological pain, he committed suicide.</p>

                    <p>Turing's entire life is one of intense struggle. From being bullied in school and work because he was different, learning to cope with personal tragedy, and dealing with his love, Turing blames himself for why he isn't normal, but it was society's fault.</p>

                    <p>One of his most endearing friends is Joan Clark, a brilliant woman alike Turing, played by Kiera Knightley, who is Turing's most supportive companion. Even though this is a true story, Clark represents a symbol of today's society and is the human carrier of Turing's historical significance.</p>

                    <p>I would be remiss if I did not mention <cite>The Imitation Game</cite> composer, Alexandre Depslat. His score is one of grand magnificence, making itself present when its effect will be noted by the audience. It, like most of the movie, represents Turing's achievements and his personality at its finest, but at times strike chords of insecurity. The score is cathartic when all of the elements on the screen and the sound assemble. </p>

                    <p>Also, to note, are the director, Morten Tyldum, and screenwriter, Graham Moore. This film could have skidded into melodrama and lost its meaning of historical significance, if it were not for their restraint and innate understanding of Turing and his story.</p>

                    <p>I wonder if World War II is taught differently in schools as a result of the declassification of Turing's effort. His triumphs helped save the world from added time in war and the families that fight it. And, reflecting on the present course of history, his misfortune is one that was and is felt by millions of people.</p>
