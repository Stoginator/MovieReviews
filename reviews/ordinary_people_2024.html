    				<p>Almost forty-four years after its premiere in movie theaters, 1980’s <cite>Ordinary People</cite> feels just as relevant today, if not more so, than when it released. Although the film follows the turbulent inner life of the Jarrett family, <cite>Ordinary People</cite> is not an exercise in maudlin. For the most part, the deepest conflicts and the well of emotion lies beneath the surface of these characters in a poignant way. This storytelling decision - to keep this telling understated - hasn’t aged a day. This film cannot be cast into the forgotten realm; it has retained its emotional power as an essential story about suburban America.</p>

                    <p>Struck by tragedy, two parents, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), are struggling to help their teenage son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton) navigate his grief. Can the parents navigate the grief themselves? Rather than deal us the heavy weight of the tragedy, director Robert Redford and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant show us indirectly. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCuY0lCLeLg">opening scene</a> of the three characters at the kitchen table is a masterstroke in writing and direction.</p>

                    <p>Calvin calls for Conrad to come downstairs for breakfast. With her back to the table, Beth waits in the kitchen with an expression of silenced anxiety, calming herself with <q>He’s just late getting ready.</q> Conrad slowly comes downstairs and sits next to his father. However, Conrad refuses to eat his favorite breakfast dish: French toast. How unusual is it for a teenage boy to not feel hungry? Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) immediately takes his plate, throws the food into the sink for trash disposal, and stays isolated from the kitchen table – symbolizing the distance she has created between herself and her son’s present state. Calvin protests: <q>Honey, he’ll eat it! Come on. It’s French toast. What are you doing?</q></p>

                    <p>Odio euismod lacinia at quis risus sed vulputate odio. Justo nec ultrices dui sapien. Sodales ut etiam sit amet nisl purus. Malesuada pellentesque elit eget gravida cum sociis. Et tortor at risus viverra adipiscing. Sed cras ornare arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut. Tellus elementum sagittis vitae et leo duis ut diam. Nibh praesent tristique magna sit amet purus gravida. Nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat id porta nibh venenatis. Diam quis enim lobortis scelerisque fermentum dui faucibus. At risus viverra adipiscing at in tellus integer.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to their son, the kitchen table scene foreshadows two parents who fundamentally disagree about the reality of the situation. With character blocking and actions derived from a kitchen table set for breakfast, we learn about these characters’ internal state. The father accepts Conrad as he is. The mother demonstrates her refusal that anything is different from before. Quickly, the audience recognizes two relationships that cannot communicate – or that refuse to honestly investigate their feelings: a husband and a wife, and, tragically, a mother and her son.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of our beliefs over the best actions for each member of this family, the audience empathizes with each character’s point of view: the son, the father, and the mother. Doing his absolute best, Conrad seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) and slowly unravels the knot of emotions that he has developed. Seeing his son’s progress and pondering himself, Calvin begins to discover an unevenness in his marriage: are my wife and I on the same page anymore? Even under the greatest of pressure, Beth maintains her shield, denying what is obvious and true. For her, if one more piece falls, then the house will come down with it; that can never happen.</p>

                    <p>I feel like I understand everyone in this family. Even from my own upbringing, I recognize so much about suburban America in this film. The pressure of conformity, the desire to maintain high expectations, and, above all, to never let abnormality publicly reveal itself – or even recognize its existence. <cite>Ordinary People</cite> takes that reflex to the storytelling extreme: what happens when a mother refuses to recognize that her son is not okay and that he needs her help?</p>

                    <p>Near the end of the film, Conrad announces to his parents that he is ready to sleep and proceeds to update them on his life. It brought a smile to my face; it is such a usual kid-moment that we never have seen Conrad perform. After the update, he announces how glad he is to see his parents and pauses. Recalling the conversation he had with his psychiatrist, he walks over to his mother and gives her a hug. Everyone is stunned; in a flash, I was on the verge of tears. Beth is unable to process what just happened. Calvin is made certain of the convictions that he reveals later. Can you tell me about a film where the tipping point is a hug between two characters? On that single action, every relationship in the family inalterably changes – and it is certainly what I will remember about this film.</p>

                    <p>As a timeless presentation of the spectrum of responses that people have when dealing with mental health issues, Robert Redford’s <cite>Ordinary People</cite> is a rare film where the quality of the performances, writing, and direction coverage to produce no less than an American classic. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay it is that I wish I had found this film earlier.</p>
