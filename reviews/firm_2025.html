                    <p>My parents discovered 1993’s <cite>The Firm</cite> on a relic of physical media: the VHS tape. It became one of their favorite films. Even though they have experienced every turn in the story, they continue to return to it. When I became of age to enjoy the film, they passed that legacy to me, making it one of my favorite films. Having seen it tens of times, you may be curious: What makes <cite>The Firm</cite> a favorite of mine?</p>

                    <p>The opening scene introduces Tom Cruise as Mitch McDeere, a Harvard Law student, running around Cambridge, Massachusetts to the tune of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2YIATHWW08j8hncRhWh1Pv">Dave Grusin’s fantastic score</a>, which relies only on the piano. Grusin conjures such tempo, anxiety, and relief with only one instrument. Partners from law firms all across the country have come to woo McDeere, offering enormous pay packages and benefits. These first minutes express what it feels like to be desired by those with wealth and power.</p>

                    <p>Mitch McDeere’s conflict is immediately apparent: If the world opened up to you like that, what path would you take? It depends on where you come from. Mitch is not the boy whose parents also went to Harvard. He knows the depths from which he came out of. He hedges every bet. He craves safety. But he wants it so bad that he fails.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Wouldn’t it be funny if I went to Harvard, you went to jail, and we both ended up surrounded by crooks?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Such is the story of <cite>The Firm</cite>. Mitch joins the Memphis-based firm offering the highest bid for his employment, Bendini, Lambert, and Locke. Unknowingly, Mitch selects the most dangerous offer — and not because of the 80-hour average workweeks of a first-year associate. There is something more sinister.</p>

                    <p>The Chicago Mafia launders funds through the firm. The F.B.I. is searching for bank records that prove it. Mitch can be the mole, but he’ll either be indicted for not cooperating with the F.B.I. or lethally erased by the Mafia upon discovery of his cooperation. If he miraculously escapes with his life after submitting confidential bank records, he will disbarred for breaking attorney-client privilege. His legal career would be terminated.</p>

                    <p>By taking the highest offer, Mitch has signed away his rights. He is a bright, ambitious man looking for the American Dream, the ultimate ascent from poverty to riches, yet he finds himself at the behest of an organized crime family and the government. It is an epic dramatic reversal: In the search for freedom, Mitch pushes his destiny outside of his control.</p>

                    <p>Enter the late, great Gene Hackman. His character, Avery Tolar, is a senior partner assigned to mentor Mitch. Tolar’s sarcastic wit, constant flirtation with women, and enthusiasm in pushing up against legal limits make him appear to be morally bankrupt. He has accepted that his career will amount to nothing but a buttress for the Mafia. Such a moral concession changes a man. In their first conversation, Mitch tries to understand Tolar’s views about the law:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Mitch: <q>How far do you want it bent?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Tolar: <q>As far as you can without breaking it.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Mitch: <q>In other words, don’t risk an IRS audit.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Tolar: <q>I don’t give a damn about an audit. They just better not win.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Tolar has no allegiance to anything but money and fun. He is a textbook cynic, looking to maximize profitability by taking full advantage of the law.</p>

                    <p>When Tolar takes Mitch to the Cayman Islands to meet a client, he signs them up to scuba dive. Then, they confront millionaire Sonny Capps (played by legendary Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub). Capps is angry about the size of his tax bill, dismissing Tolar’s insistence that the firm’s strategy defers his tax burden into the future:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Are you telling me who’s gonna be in the White House the next four years? ‘Cause that would be valuable information.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>The abrasive nature of Sonny Capps does not throw Mitch on his back foot. Quite the opposite. Using what he crammed the day before, Mitch verbally assaults Capps back:</p>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>The worst thing is next year they're going to close the loophole, change the regs, and if you haven't grabbed this proposal, you're gonna feel like you were f**ked with a d**k big enough for an elephant to feel it.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>After Mitch overperforms in the meeting, Tolar immediately makes him his protégé. Cynics do not invest in people this easily, so we sense something more. Who is Tolar really?</p>

                    <p>On this dramatic question, Hackman walks a fine line, causing an internal debate within the audience. We wonder: Is this a good man who has gone awry?  In typical Hollywood fashion, we must wait until the very end of his journey to uncover the truth. One of Tolar’s last lines is delivered in a drug-induced stupor, teasing Mitch in his unique way:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I knew he was a closet idealist.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>It takes one to know one.</p>

                    <p>There are many great supporting performances in <cite>The Firm</cite> from Hal Holbrook to Ed Harris and Holly Hunter with David Strathairn. All of them surround the core story with a living texture: Mitch must find a way to escape with the fullness of his life intact. Yet, his relationship with his wife, Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), generates <cite>The Firm</cite>’s staying power.</p>

                    <p>Mitch and Abby are the heart and soul of <cite>The Firm</cite>, which is evident from their first scene in a rundown Boston studio apartment. Their chemistry simply leaps off the screen. The characters talk to each other like an actual married couple. They are best friends, so we root for them.</p>

                    <p>If you remove the ebb and flow of their marriage from the film, then <cite>The Firm</cite> ceases to be so dramatically satisfying. Mitch’s desperation in escaping the Mafia or the government’s reach isn’t as emotionally potent. To me, it feels like the worst thing that can happen is Mitch and Abby divorce each other because of the desperate circumstances they find themselves in.</p>

                    <p>Thirty two years after <cite>The Firm</cite>'s release, the marriage dynamic plays well against much of Tom Cruise’s most popular work like <cite>Mission: Impossible</cite> where he is the hero who saves the day. We have a feeling that he will find a way to escape his predicament but are perplexed on the question of whether he can salvage his marriage.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Firm</cite> has the filmmaking fundamentals that never go out of the audience’s favor. Screenwriters David Rabe, David Rayfiel, and Robert Towne (of 1974’s <cite>Chinatown</cite>) created a traditional Hollywood script, full of double entendres, quick-wit, and snappy dialogue. It’s the kind of writing that I rarely hear in modern films. In their hands, the proceedings never grow boring, especially because the film deviates from the novel to improve on the plot.</p>

                    <p>Next, add director Sydney Pollack to Tom Cruise’s long list of collaborations. In <cite>The Firm</cite>, Pollack’s steady hand is reluctant to show off, preferring subtlety and quiet command. He hides the seams of construction very well. In the beginning, split diopter shots between Mitch and the other attorneys foreshadow the double life of Bendini, Lambert, and Locke. As the identities of everyone involved becomes clearer, the split diopter shots create tension as we wonder if Mitch’s high-wire act of deception could unravel. To compensate for the film’s runtime, Pollack places dialogue in voiceover as the setting changes from Cambridge to cityscape views of Memphis to the coral reefs of the Cayman Islands. I was so engrossed that I missed these attributes for years.</p>

                    <p>After all the hoopla, Mitch finds a way to escape with his freedom without risking his career or personal safety. Compared to John Grisham’s book, the screenwriters found a much more compelling way to resolve the story. In a three-scene sequence, three dramatic questions are resolved one scene after another:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Will Mitch escape the Mafia and secure his personal safety?</li>
                            <li>Will Mitch stay out of the government’s looming indictment of the firm?</li>
                            <li>Will Mitch save his marriage with Abby?</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>He decides to turn over records of serial over-billing to the government, but he needs signatures from one last client to release their charge statements: the Morolto brothers who run the Mafia. Mitch flees to Chicago and confronts the two men who bankroll the firm:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I’m your lawyer, gentlemen. Whether I like it or not, I can’t talk to the government about you even when I’m no longer your lawyer. That would be breaking my word. My oath.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>To ensure his safety in perpetuity, Mitch offers a veiled threat:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I just felt it was important for me to be thoroughly familiar with the precise makeup and whereabouts of all your holdings and activities, so I prepared copies of everything…. Right down to the penny, Pound, franc, and Deutschmark. I know everything you know, as I should, as your attorney.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>If Mitch goes, they go, too. Attorney-client privilege is useless if the attorney is dead but his knowledge is stored - free to be used in any way.</p>

                    <p>At his bugged home, Mitch gives Wayne Terrance (Ed Harris), the F.B.I. agent on the case, all the documents of over-billing on every partner on the firm. When the firm mailed any of the documents, it was mail fraud, a real crime when the postal service is used to deceive others into paying more than they owe. The scale and coordination of the crimes elevate it to racketeering: Lots of fines and jail time. Terrance fails to understand, until Mitch explains what he accomplished:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I won my life back. You don’t run me and they don’t run me.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Terrance considers this. When he leaves, he asks:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>How in the hell did you ever come up with mail fraud?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>As Terrance leaves, a dog enters. We know who is there.</p>

                    <p>They are seeing each other for the first time after the most consequential events of their lives. Some small talk fills the air. They are finding a rhythm again. Then, like a true lawyer, Mitch cuts to the heart of his concern:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Did I lose you?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Abby considers his question. So do we. This is her response:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>I’ve loved you all my life. Even before we met. Part of it wasn’t even you, it was just a promise of you. But these last days, you kept your promise. How could you lose me?</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Notice how deliberately her dialogue is constructed. The climax of <cite>The Firm</cite> hangs on her every word. The first three sentences are truthful but could go either way. The fourth sentence is abstract, but I believe Mitch’s promise is what he was always searching for: Safety. Like an ideal partner, he promised to keep Abby safe.</p>

                    <p>When he resolved the two dilemmas pulling his marriage apart, he dug himself out of a self-induced hole and saved his marriage. In a few lines, Abby reaffirms that she wasn’t looking for immense wealth or worldly importance in her marriage. She was looking for protection.</p>

                    <p>Lucky for them both, they found it in law and love.</p>
