    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>New war films enter a crowded genre, with its best modern works recallable by everyday moviegoers: 1998’s <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite>, 2017’s <cite>Dunkirk</cite>, 2019’s <cite>1917</cite>. Any new entrants demand a very strong reason for existence. <cite>Warfare</cite> is the latest addition, so what does it bring to the conversation?</p>

                    <p><cite>Warfare</cite> is inspired by American soldiers’ memories of a battle in Ramadi, Iraq in 2006. It was co-directed by Alex Garland, one of the most thought-provoking filmmakers working today, and Ray Mendoza, a former Navy Seal whose experiences coat the film. The film recreates memories of an attack to give the audience access to the original events. In doing so, the lines between a documentary and realistic fiction are heavily blurred.</p>

                    <p>Compared to its counterparts, <cite>Warfare</cite> is atypical, refusing to use the same filmmaking tools that contributed to the success of other films. Each creative choice was made to stay as true to memory as possible. Absolute authenticity is what makes <cite>Warfare</cite> different. The film was designed to not take any dramatic license.</p>

                    <p>Events and dialogue are presented exactly as they are remembered. This means the dialogue is not simplified for a non-military audience. We must parse through the unaltered military jargon, even when it is complex, to understand what is next. Except for personal conversations between soldiers, there is no recourse from this approach. This heightens our sense of confusion — and, unexpectedly, helps us empathize with them. We grasp their sense of confusion as the mission goes haywire. We tap into the soldiers’ collective urge to survive. It makes a desperate situation even scarier.</p>

                    <p>Another dramatic technique, which I find fascinating, is Alex Garland’s tendency to strip out as much context from his stories as possible. Rather than directly answering questions about set-up, he expects the audience to build the context themselves. Why are the soldiers in a house? What is their mission? Your answer is as good as theirs. This technique makes the story participatory for the audience, involving us deeper in the conflict when it arrives.</p>

                    <p>Take the film’s exposition, which is untraditional. It is brief, limited to a single scene that has no dialogue and only two distinct camera angles: one of a television and another of the soldiers gathered around it. It is deliberately simple. To engage with this experience, all we need to know is that these men are banded together in a brotherhood. There is a deep trust developed between them that extends to the field of battle.</p>

                    <p><cite>Warfare</cite>’s essential “gimmick” is its use of time. In movies, a year can flash by in minutes. However, <cite>Warfare</cite>’s events are connected in real-time. If a character says, “3 mikes out,” the film takes three minutes to reach the event in reference. Once the soldiers are posted, the editing only shifts between human perspectives in the same location and never travels through time. While this is dramatically unnecessary in other films, this concept underpins the audience’s constant sense of threat in <cite>Warfare</cite>. You have to wait with the soldiers for the cavalry — if it ever comes at all. No one is safe.</p>

                    <p>In yet another departure from established genre tradition, <cite>Warfare</cite> purposefully excludes a film score, contrasting itself with the rousing work that John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and Thomas Newman composed. The soldiers did not listen to music during their attack. The sense of heroism that we normally feel, as we watch soldiers in combat, is missing. It is replaced with something more truthful.</p>

                    <p>There is one area where <cite>Warfare</cite> continues a longstanding tradition by delivering an outstanding sound mix, yet does so in a distinct way. When heard properly, the first gunshots in the movie hit your chest; the mixers are using speakers to literally pierce the air. When the battle begins, it becomes full-on cacophony. Sonic bombardment is a technique that Alex Garland also used in 2024’s <cite>Civil War</cite>. In both films, the sound mix becomes a source of trauma.</p>

                    <p>Finally, to complete the co-directors’ approach to filmmaking, there is no point of view or bigger meaning expressed in the chaos. <cite>Warfare</cite> is not an editorial. The creators did not make this film to opine on a political underpinnings of the Iraq War like 2010’s <cite>Green Zone</cite>. Rather, they endeavored to bring the audience into a real-time body of feelings. When I processed the film with this lens, it broke open for me.</p>

                    <p>Their intention is to create an experience of war that refuses to glorify its subjects and depict them with pure realism. In other words, they decided to put the heart of these men on-screen without the Hollywood pizzazz. <cite>Warfare</cite> bravely departs from the conventions of epic films in the genre — and it succeeds.</p>
                    
                    <p>After finishing the experience of <cite>Warfare</cite>, the uneasiness stays because the scale of <cite>Warfare</cite>’s trauma is massive. This was fourteen men in one battalion in one town in Iraq. But there are thousands of these stories from the Iraq War. What does all this mean to the survivors? What does it mean to the families of those who did not survive?</p>
                    
                    <p>This emotional reckoning is left out of <cite>Warfare</cite>, because the filmmakers trust the audience to naturally question what we saw. Twenty four years after 9/11, we are still dealing with the consequences of our response. When you realize the scale of America’s actions, the first question that came to my mind is: Was it worth it? Why did these men have to put their lives on the line — in such an inconsequential way?</p>

                    <p>Intelligently, <cite>Warfare</cite> refuses to opine on its subject matter as I have done. It is a real-time experience that locks you into the moment. There’s no Hollywood-sensibility here, except an understanding of story structure. Its unconventional, cinematic construction dares to immerse the audience in the truth of battle. That in too many cases, all that trauma does not amount to much. Afterwards, you must do the work of emotionally unwinding from the experience. It lingers — as it should.</p>

                    <p>In a way, <cite>Warfare</cite> has extended the opening act of <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite> to an entire film. That is its level of intensity. But it has stripped away the glory from the fight. The hero in that film, played by an American icon in actor Tom Hanks, is nowhere to be found. <cite>Warfare</cite> cast new faces, in part, to convey how the cost of battle is borne by ordinary Americans.</p>

                    <p>Their faces prove that, when these men are in combat, they are not fighting to save democracy, eliminate insurgents, or epitomize the American way. These higher purposes are out of mind.</p>

                    <p>Rather, they are fighting for their own survival and to keep their brotherhood alive by any means necessary. That is the truth of <cite>Warfare</cite>. It is also why Elliott Miller, a survivor of the events in the film, describes it as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N1JQ1P1_dc&t=319s">love story</a>.</p>
