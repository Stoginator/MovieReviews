    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>More so than other genres, horror movies demand storytelling innovations to avoid becoming stale. Recently, the trend in horror has been to focus on main characters dealing with trauma and place them into desperate situations. Carrying forth this tradition, <cite>Talk to Me</cite> features the same type of emotional entanglements that have elevated the horror in recent films of the genre like 2016’s <cite>A Quiet Place</cite>, 2017’s <cite>Hereditary</cite>, and 2022’s <cite>Smile</cite>. With their new film, two more first-time feature film directors, Danny and Michael Philippou, join the new echelon of horror creators. What they bring to <cite>Talk to Me</cite> uniquely adds to the mix.</p>

                    <p>The intriguing device, featured prominently in the marketing, is the film's launching pad. A mysterious hand, covered in letters from dozens of languages, lets its users experience what cannot be otherwise accessed. Light a candle, grab the hand, and speak the words: <q>Talk to me.</q> As you might imagine, that is the beginning of an ugly descent for a normal group of kids.</p>

                    <p>My friend, who introduced me to the film, says <cite>Talk to Me</cite> wisely avoids common horror tropes: car crashes, dead pets and babies, and exorcisms. Much of the fun for audiences is guessing what happens next. <cite>Talk to Me</cite> toes the line of our enjoyment, presenting distasteful events but never going too far. By introducing various red-herrings, the film never makes it easy to guess right.</p>

                    <p>Phones have a mighty presence in the film. Even if they are ubiquitous in life, it still feels unusual to see iMessages, flashlights, and characters holding up black metal blocks in movies. It contributes to air of anxiety that peaks in the second half of <cite>Talk to Me</cite>, as the main character, Mia (Sophie Wilde), finds herself in increasingly disturbing predicaments. It is the idea that every misdeed is permanently captured and out of your control. For most of the second half, the audience enters Mia’s perspective: a dreary, unpredictable, and lonely experience. Memorably, the film finds ways to project the raw nature of Mia’s emotions on us.</p>

                    <p>Not many movies feel genuinely gut-wrenching like this, which is a testament to the combination of the prosthetics, cinematography, and sound mix. The designs of the spirit faces are spectacularly disgusting to look at; although, just like the characters, it is hard to avert your eyes. Varying between handheld and mounted, the camerawork adds to the anxiety of the story. The handheld shots make an obvious case, but some of the mounted shots with characters center-frame are unsettlingly still and freaky. Very often in the shots with the camera slowly moving in, something feels wrong. On the sound side, the composer, Cornel Wilczek, crafted an unnerving, high-pitch, string-heavy score (as an example, listen to <cite>Riley's Possession</cite>). Due to the wide dynamic range of the mix, there are some unpredictable jump scare moments that avoid the genre's tropes and seem to appear out of thin air. As a viewer, I felt my emotional reactions were earned by good filmmaking.</p>

                    <p>As the film progressed, it became more apparent that the central conceit of <cite>Talk to Me</cite> was an allegory for drug abuse. A wounded teenager succumbs to her trauma, looks for kicks, and embraces “the hand.” After one go, she wants no more, but she is peer pressured into experiencing one more dose. She instantly becomes addicted.</p>

                    <p>Everyone around her joins in. Bad experiences are normalized. A family member’s hospitalization and the story of someone’s death are not deterrents. When the first accident happens, what feels like the only solution? More of it. The dealers never suffer any consequences. Their customers must live with them. What can you do when someone you love suffers from repeating the same mistakes? As Ali, the standout character on HBO’s <cite>Euphoria</cite>, says, <q>That is the disease of addiction.</q></p>

                    <p>Underneath the surface, <cite>Talk to Me</cite> feels like an incredibly personal film, using the horror genre to deliver a Trojan Horse in the form of an allegory. It works well - satiating viewers interested in layers and simply remaining under the surface for those who just prefer the horror.</p>

                    <p><cite>Talk to Me</cite> does horror right: getting us to care about the characters first and making the horror about the surprisingly terrible things that could happen to them. I am not a particularly squeamish viewer, but there are some repulsive items on screen. Viewers beware, it is worse than you can imagine.</p>

                    <p><i>P.S. Shoutout to all the Australians and New Zealanders involved in the making of this movie! Especially, the shieldmaiden of Rohan herself, Miranda Otto!</i></p>
