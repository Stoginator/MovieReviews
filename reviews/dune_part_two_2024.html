    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Throughout 2021’s <cite>Dune</cite>, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) sees the same girl from Arrakis in his slow-motion visions. Clothes rattle in the oppressive desert wind, long hair flows over eyes, and steps imprint in the sand like they do in perfect dreams. The girl that Paul sees is a Fremen, a native of the desert. Her name is Chani (Zendaya).</p>

                    <p>During the climax of <cite>Dune</cite>, Paul is forced to fight another Fremen, Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), in an ancient dueling ritual. Before their encounter, Paul enters a waking dream foreseeing himself being stabbed by Jamis’s Crysknife, the blade of the Fremen made from a sand worm’s tooth. Chani knocks Paul out of his hallucination to lend her grandmother’s Crysknife: <q>This would be a great honor, for you to die holding it.</q> The moment is imminent. Will Paul Atreides suffer a slow death?</p>

                    <p>Paul’s vision manifests, but not in the way we expect. He bests Jamis multiple times in the duel – and, each time, he refuses to take his opponent’s life. Trapped by the life-or-death constraints of the ritual, Paul kills Jamis with Chani’s Crysknife. With this death, the visual language of dreams enters reality.</p>

                    <p>After the last rites, the aftermath of Paul’s action is seen in slow-motion. With his hair covering his face, Paul walks through a row of Fremen. Chani glides down the rock she sat upon to witness the duel. Whether she believes in the prophecy of a Messiah or not, she is a part of it. Even though Paul wants nothing to do with a prophecy, now it has been set in motion. These characters do not know it yet.</p>

                    <p>To avenge his father, Paul will become a Fremen, telling the group’s skeptical leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem):</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"My father came, not for spice, not for riches, but for the strength of your people. My road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you’ll have us, we will come.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Set to Han Zimmer’s outro for the film, <cite>My Road Leads into the Desert</cite>, a passionate, female voice blares into our ears and a current of bass hits our chests. In <cite>Dune</cite>, there are many names for a savior: Messiah, Kwisatz Haderach, the Voice from the Outer Worlds, the Lisan al’Gaib. Is Paul the One who will liberate these people from their oppression? What role will Chani and Paul's mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), play in fulfilling the prophecy? Who is the Emperor and what does he seek? That is the set-up and the promise of <cite>Dune: Part Two.</cite></p>

                    <p>Part One begins with a menacing, otherworldly Sardaukar voice uttering:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Dreams are messages from the deep.”</blockquote>

                    <p>It serves an ingenious and dual function, marking a tonal shift from the heavy marketing of movie trailers and setting the tables for the narrative force driving Part One. There was no doubt that director Denis Villeneuve would return to this tool in the second part. In my household, a great debate ignited over what would be said: <q>Prophecy marks the path of the righteous.</q> Maybe. <q>War will come to those who seek it.</q> No, no, definitely not. As thirty minutes worth of trailers subsided to a pitch-black auditorium, we hear the same Sardaukar voice speak:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Power over Spice is power over all.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The two-and-a-half-year wait was over; all the worldbuilding homework of <cite>Dune</cite> was behind us. We were going to see the very thing that Paul Atreides fears the most: Holy War.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“In the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets. But the darkest of them all may remain: the end of House Atreides.”</blockquote>

                    <p>For a second time, screenwriters Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts display a mastery of prologue, condensing the entire story of <cite>Dune</cite> and the dramatic questions of <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> into a brief monologue spoken by the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). The prologue is immense in its purpose and its cinematic awesomeness, remarking on the tragic “liquidation” of House Atreides and introducing the most mysterious figure in the universe: the Emperor. Why would the Emperor conspire against Paul’s father, Leto Atreides, a leader he loved like a son?</p>

                    <p>Opening the film and foreshadowing events to come, Han Zimmer’s track, <cite>Eclipse</cite>, contains the main theme of <cite>Holy War</cite>, which plays during the finest scene of <cite>Dune</cite> when Paul is frightened by visions of a <q>holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire!</q></p>

                    <p>However, the similarities between Zimmer’s first outing and the sequel are limited. The <em>thumping</em> drums of <cite>Dune</cite> are pitched down, relegated to the deep background; in the same manner, that piercing female voice is a rare presence in <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, signaling the turning of prophecy into reality each time we hear it. Zimmer has crafted a new set of musical themes that expand the universe and, eventually, help us grasp transformation.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>As Paul trains in the ways of the Fremen, Jessica is forced to become a Reverend Mother to their people. As is tradition, she must drink a blue poison derived from a sand worm known as the “Water of Life.” The prophecy predicts that the Messiah’s mother will survive such a poisoning. When Jessica does, the Fremen are split between the believers and the non-believers, the devout, Southern fundamentalists versus the young, doubtful Northerners. Lady Jessica becomes obsessed with the prophecy at play, spreading beliefs that the Messiah has come and converting the Fremen. Paul refuses to accept any belief that he is the Lisan al’Gaib, the Fremen word for Messiah.</p>

                    <p>Seeing his reluctance to embrace a Messiah myth, Chani helps train Paul, whose storied abilities as a fierce fighter spread across Arrakis. When they take down a spice harvester together, Paul completes the second part of the prophecy as the female voice rises at the end of the track, <cite>Harvester Attack</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Through battle and time, the two develop an intense fascination with each other. Paul sees the intelligent girl from his dreams, while Chani, gazing upon a sincere and capable outsider, reciprocates. Captured entirely in natural light, the hues of the desert surround the couple with a divine beauty of orange and gold. With the musical theme, <cite>A Time of Quiet Between the Storms</cite>, we fall for these two, hoping their love can conquer the cruelty of the Harkonnens.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>One by one, Paul inadvertently fulfills more steps of the prophecy. Paul destroys an invading ship with Chani and embraces a Fremen name, Paul Maud’dib Usul, for the North Star that points the way. In a spectacular showcase, he successfully rides a grandfather sand worm, earning him the right to be one of the people. As each event unfolds, the Bene Gesserit voice guides his path. (Listen to 0:44 to 0:52 of <cite>Worm Ride</cite>.) As Paul accumulates trust and belief in his new community, not even the Harkonnens are immune to the building legend.</p>

                    <p>Due to Fremen resistance, the Harkonnens’ spice production has collapsed. Their leader, the Baron (Stellan Skargard), is aggrieved. The Harkonnens’ ground forces are afraid of the one called Maud’dib, an unstoppable fighter who lurks in the shadows. Even the Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), the vicious commander on Arrakis, cannot stop him.</p>

                    <p>In the halls of the powerful, Paul Atreides is thought dead. To maintain their proximity to power, the Bene Gesserit have another prospect who can lay claim to Arrakis and the Emperor’s throne: Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler). In a society of decadence and blatant cruelty, Feyd-Rautha’s best tool is fear.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“You fought well, Atreides.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The raw power on display is captured in Zimmer’s track, <cite>Harkonnen Arena</cite>, a seriously intimidating series of noises. Feyd-Rautha is a skilled gladiator, putting on a show for the Harkonnens by killing the last remaining member of House Atreides (so they believe). In their own difficult duels, both Paul and Feyd-Rautha have come through the fire alive to tell their tale.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“I don't care if you believe. I believe!”</blockquote>

                    <p>On Arrakis, Paul cannot stop the legend of Maud’dib from spreading. The religious fundamentalists believe that their Messiah has arrived. He does not seek this path. His mother awaits him in a Fremen temple, where the next step of the prophecy is to drink the blue worm poison, the “Water of Life,” which no man has ever survived. Paul succumbs to temptation: could he be the one?</p>

                    <p>While unconscious, Paul accesses the entirety of his family tree: the departed, the living, and the unborn, learning through thousands of years of experience. Given the physical and mental toll of this process, Paul lies sedated in the temple where he drank. A heartbroken Chani, infuriated by the fundamentalists who she thinks poisoned Paul, combines her teardrop with a splash of worm poison on her finger. When she touches Paul’s lips, he is resurrected. As the hardest part of the prophecy is fulfilled, the Bene Gesserit voice rings clearest in <cite>Resurrection</cite>.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“The visions are clear now. I see possible futures, all at once. Our enemies are all around us, and in so many futures they prevail. But I do see a way. There is a narrow way through.”</blockquote>

                    <p>After Paul drinks the “Water of Life,” a Holy War in his name is no longer an event he fears. Now, the death of billions and a world of dried apocalypse is destiny. Yet, Paul is not consumed by his previous fears. He is processing a piece of information that rewrites everything: Lady Jessica is the long-lost daughter of the Baron.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“Mom, we're Harkonnens.”</blockquote>

                    <p>With this, a new set of dramatic questions rises to the forefront: will Paul choose the path of his father, Duke Leto, or the path of his grandfather, the Baron? In other words, will Paul free the people of Arrakis or will he become their next oppressor? So much of fantasy relies on the hero’s journey. But, when our hero is a descendent of the most brutal House in the galaxy, we must ask: is Paul Atreides the hero of this story?</p>

                    <p>The overarching turning point of both films lies in the transformation of how Paul sees his fate. At first, Paul rejects the Messianic prophecy and the Bene Gesserit’s meddling in the natural way by crossing bloodlines. But, as he sees many destinies laid out, he embraces his role as the Voice from the Outer Worlds.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Lady Jessica: “Your father didn't believe in revenge.”</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Paul Atreides: “Well, I do.”</blockquote>

                    <p>In the finest scene of <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, Paul goes in front of the Fremen, breaking their religious rules to speak freely as a non-leader. Zimmer’s track <cite>Southern Messiah</cite> illustrates the mood of the room as he swaps the pulse of Part One’s <cite>Dream of Arrakis</cite> with voices. Paul finalizes his grip on power using the clarity of his vision – and weaponizes the Fremen’s faith against them.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“This could be the moment you've been praying for, all your life.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Paul’s entire story converges in front of the Fremen. Putting on his father’s ring, Paul realizes the assassination of his father made him a martyr, led him to the Fremen, and to the precipice of becoming the Emperor. Chalamet’s performance in this scene sells the transformation of Paul from a boy frightened by his own visions to a fearsome man embracing prophecy. It is the second tipping point of the film: we understand why the Fremen choose to follow this Voice from the Outer Worlds – and we see that Paul has embraced his father’s wisdom in a way neither of them ever expected:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“A great man doesn't seek to lead. He is called to it.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Stilgar, a great skeptic of Paul in Part One, is a measure of transformation for the Fremen; he rises with religious ecstasy that the Lisan al’Gaib has arrived. One of the last survivors of House Atreides, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) feels the intense emotion of the moment, seeing the son of Duke Leto ascend to the throne. Most significantly, Chani, the lover of the Messiah, is the only remaining non-believer. Missing the sincere freedom-fighter, she resents how Paul has won over her people with his myth. She knows this story only ends one way. The tragedy of Paul Atreides is the simple cliché: <q>Power corrupts absolutely.</q></p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“I am Paul Maud’dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis!”</blockquote>

                    <p>This dramatic situation is where <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> carves its place in the annals of cinema. In this moment of religious fervor, the cycle of violence, prophecy commanding reality, and a hero’s arc are all here, so we believe. Up until this moment, <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> felt like an unfolding love story, but something else clouds the air: Revenge.</p>

                    <p>Paul leads the Fremen to stage an attack on the Harkonnens and the Emperor. Launching three atomics, <cite>Dune</cite>’s iteration of nuclear weapons, the army deactivates the enemy’s shields. Cloaked in a head covering and fearing no one, Paul meets his grandfather, the Baron, for the first time and slits his throat. Maud’dib summons the most powerful members of the galaxy to the same room. Awaiting their arrival and having seen a vision of the future leading to one moment, a Crysknife grasped by two hands, Paul turns to Chani to express what becomes their final words:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“I want you to know that I will love you as long as I breathe.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The two films rest upon a prime relationship between Paul and Chani that provides the arc of transformation. In <cite>Dune</cite>, Paul sees a beautiful, mysterious Fremen girl in his dreams and, at the end, he finally meets her. In <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, they fall in love as Paul becomes one of her people. Paul seeks to liberate the Fremen, but what will he do in the moment of greatest pressure? Will he elevate a Fremen to the throne of the galaxy or will he claim the most powerful partner?</p>

                    <p>As the Emperor, his daughter, and his Sardaukar forces enter the room, the frightening Maud’dib reveals his true self: Paul Atreides. Only Paul knows this place is truly an arena, a venue for the final battle between him and the Emperor. Sensing Paul’s ultimate ambition to sit upon the galactic throne, the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit warns him:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“Consider what you are about to do, Paul Atreides.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Using all his strength to condemn the woman who once dismissed his mother, Lady Jessica, in her own home, Paul rejects her warning:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“SILENCE!”</blockquote>

                    <p>Facing the sheer power of Paul’s Voice, she falls backwards into the other sisters as a burst of vibration passes through the audience. Recognizing the full history of Paul’s bloodline as an Atreides and a Harkonnen, his mastery of the Bene Gesserit ways as a male, and his command of the Fremen legion, all the Reverend Mother can remark is:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"Abomination.”</blockquote>

                    <p>With no barriers left in his path, Paul challenges the Emperor to a duel. And, in a mirror of <cite>Dune</cite>’s climactic fight, Feyd-Rautha elects to be the Emperor’s champion.</p>

                    <p>During the climax, I was not so sure whose side I should take. Was there a difference?  Even though <cite>Dune</cite> is set in the tenth millennium, justice is not dealt by an impartial jury, but by the blade. Claims to power know no morals. Introducing himself to his cousin, Paul memorializes House Atreides in a whisper:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"May thy knife chip and shatter.”</blockquote>

                    <p>In the best impersonation of his uncle, Feyd-Rautha reciprocates Paul’s saying with respect.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"May <u>thy</u> knife chip and shatter.”</blockquote>

                    <p>And with Feyd-Rautha's first punch, the fight for the galaxy was on. The choreography of the duel is built into three dramatic parts. In the opening, Feyd-Rautha bests Paul by landing him on the ground with a bloodied face. Feyd-Rautha follows Paul’s gaze towards Chani, who he remarks is Paul’s “pet.”</p>

                    <p>As the second phase begins, an invigorated Paul rises and slams his chest three times as a Fremen would. The duo clash again in a brutal trading of blows until Feyd-Rautha lands a blade in Paul’s abdomen and steals Paul’s blade. It must be over. Has the Messiah himself fallen in battle?</p>

                    <p>Feyd-Rautha rushes up to Paul to deliver the final blow: a knife to the heart. This is the moment that Paul saw in his visions: the convergence of past, present, and future. Two hands grasping the same Crysknife. What happens now will decide who controls the galaxy. Redirecting Feyd-Rautha’s blade, Paul sends it into his own shoulder. At the same time, Paul pierces his opponent with the blade that landed in his abdomen. He has done what Gurney Halleck teaches him in his training lessons in <cite>Dune</cite>. On the opposite side of an Atreides blade, Feyd-Rautha musters the same sentiment that he voiced in the Harkonnen Arena:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"You fought well, Atreides.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Paul has won the ultimate throne. But killing the Emperor’s champion is not enough. To finally avenge his father, Paul wants the Emperor’s head, too. Instead of more bloodshed, Princess Irulan promises to accept Paul’s hand in marriage but only if he spares her father. Behind Paul in a crowd of her people, Chani stands betrayed… shocked… and reduced to the role of concubine. In Chani’s mind, Paul’s ascendance has made him the very oppression that he promised to help the Fremen banish. Paul accepts the Princess’s proposal.</p>

                    <p>As the Fremen celebrate their Lisan al’Gaib, Chani runs far away from the arena, leaving behind her people. In her expressions, I felt that she missed the home she once knew and the sense of normalcy that was lost with Paul’s transformation. Placing a thumper into the desert sand, in a cacophony of emotions, one thing was clear: she was wondering whether Harkonnen cruelty is better than the feeling of oppression from the one you love. The Harkonnens are pure evil, but Paul was not supposed to be one of them.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>Kiss the Ring</cite>, the love theme that was established so clearly becomes the betrayal theme. Using the romantic arc of the film, Hans Zimmer subverts his own score to underline Paul’s transformation from a simple freedom fighter rejecting any notion of grandeur in his destiny to the Lisan al’Gaib who uses a story to unquestionably rule Arrakis for a lifetime. The love that gave rise to a Messiah is cast away for more power. Without a clear resolution, it is up to us to decide: do Paul’s final words to Chani mean more than his actions?</p>

                    <p><cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> is a tale of subversion. We believe Paul is on a path to be the Messiah. Naturally, we think he is <em>the</em> hero if there is such a thing in this world. By the end of this film, you could place any themes that Hans Zimmer made for the Harkonnens in scenes with Paul, and it would not feel out of place. After Paul’s rampage, the same cruelty and lust for power exist equally in both lineages. Paul may have banished the Harkonnens from Arrakis, but did he just replace their rule with his own? Will Arrakis ever solely be the Fremen’s planet?</p>

                    <p>I expected <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> to be a tale about a generation breaking the cycles of violence that preceded them. It is not. Rather, the film is about how the next generation continues them. To showcase this, Denis Villeneuve has assembled some of the best, young talent in Hollywood and surrounded them with proven, established actors.</p>

                    <p>Denis Villeneuve foreshadows this subversion in the film’s language. In the beginning of the film, Villeneuve introduces a city on Arrakis using an establishing shot with onscreen titles: “Arrakeen: Northern Arrakis.” A few scenes later, Villeneuve introduces a new location with onscreen titles, “Spice Field,” only to blow up everything in the frame, surprising the audience and cinematically showing us what we should expect next.</p>

                    <p>Villeneuve has clearly been inspired by the sound mixes of Christopher Nolan’s films, which is to say, 3-D glasses are overrated. The real third-dimension of <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> is feeling the power of this sound mix vibrate your chest. In an IMAX theater, Villeneuve uses the sound system to tap us into the sensation of a sand worm surfing the sand, the energy of a mass of Harkonnens, or the religious fervor of the Fremen. The screen falls away, and the distance between us and Arrakis feels like inches. It greatly enhances the emotional richness of the film; it must be felt.</p>

                    <p>Just before the curtains closed on <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, the passion of the moment revealed a deeper truth: this is a film that will be remembered in fifty years. Both of Villeneuve’s films are products of a very particular era of two-hundred million-dollar films laden with computer-generated-imagery. Yet, <cite>Dune</cite> and <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite> elucidate a world like the best science fiction films have done before it. Perhaps, that is because many of the modern epics were inspired by Frank Herbert’s original 1965 novel.</p>

                    <p>Think of the prophecy of Harry Potter as the Chosen One (i.e., Messiah) in 2007’s <cite>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</cite>. Remember the Na’vi accepting the demon outsider, Jake Sully, as their leader when he successfully rides the greatest bird (i.e., a sand worm) in the sky in 2009’s <cite>Avatar</cite>? How about Anakin Skywalker (i.e., Paul Atreides) subverting the prophecy of the Jedi and descending on a path of darkness in 2005’s <cite>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</cite>? <cite>Dune</cite> is the archetype for many, many stories in our culture.</p>

                    <p>Just as 1977’s <cite>Star Wars</cite> did for its generation, future filmmakers will tell the story of how they descended <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/dune-2-box-office-milestone-400-million-1235944137/">into an IMAX theater</a> to watch Denis Villeneuve’s <cite>Dune</cite> and came out transformed by its story. When the end credits rolled, I felt honored to sit in the cinema with the knowledge that I was witnessing history. For young people in the future, I would bet that one of the coolest things to say might be, “I saw <cite>Dune</cite> in theaters way back in the day.”</p>
