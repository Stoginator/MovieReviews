    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Is this really happening? This was the thought that jostled around my mind throughout <cite>Rosemary's Baby</cite>. In a haunting, circling plot with serious implications, could Rosemary really be the victim of elderly witches? This story, almost entirely confined to a New York City apartment, establishes peak dramatic tension - not because of what we do not know, but what we fear is the truth. Is there a point when circumstantial evidence and the veneer of appearances convinced me that Rosemary’s experiences were, in fact, due to witchcraft? I did not fully believe it until it was too late.</p>

                    <p>Again and again, Rosemary’s experiences are peculiar, yet just mundane enough to give us room for doubt: laced chocolate mousse, a smelly charm filled with “tannis root,” a drink made from special herbs from nosey neighbors, a daily, searing pain during pregnancy, a well-respected obstetrician who may be plotting against her, and a husband who seems to be complicit in the whole scheme. She has a horrifying dream, too despicable to wonder about. No single detail or combination of them pushes us over the edge, but the dread remains. Something bad is coming.</p>

                    <p>In a nuanced performance, the film is carried by Mia Farrow, the titular Rosemary. It is a difficult role, not just off of the script, but in its direction. She walks through city traffic, holds long takes masterfully, and always seems to strike the right chord. Rosemary’s husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), has one foot in the scheme and one foot out of it, reluctantly deceiving his wife for personal gain, right in front of us. The chemistry between these two actors - first, to exude a couple in love, and then be at extreme odds - breathes believability into the story.  Even on a first watch, I thought Krzysztof Komeda’s score plays with such a wide range, bouncing from the wonderfully benign tunes of <cite>Christmas</cite> and <cite>Moment Musical</cite> to the eerie <cite>The Coven</cite> and the beautiful violins of <cite>Happy News</cite>. With some characteristic instruments of the times rarely heard today, it is a representative score of 1968’s Hollywood.</p>

                    <p>I was most struck by a scene where Rosemary wakes up from a sedation given to her by Dr. Sapirstein during childbirth. But, the baby is gone. Guy sits on the bed’s edge, offering her a most disquieting explanation. She progressively gets louder with her assertions, <q>You’re lying. It didn’t die. You took it!</q> A group of neighbors come in from another room. Rosemary is held down and sedated once again. Is this really happening? And that moment when the doubt creeps in, after all that we have seen Rosemary go through, is the true dagger of the film.</p>

                    <p>In the greatest moment of crisis, I seriously wondered, <q>They can’t be who we think they are, right?</q> Coincidence be damned, we know Rosemary’s baby is in danger, yet I still questioned her conviction. In this way, Polanski’s direction brings out our hidden complicity. I was looking for the fault in Rosemary’s lived experience, rather than room for failure in my own judgement. So did Dr. Hill who, after listening to Rosemary's entire story, calls Dr. Sapirstein rather than the police.</p>

                    <p>It is an important detail that all the Satanists look like everyday fellas you would see on the street. Gloriously celebrating the pilfering of a woman’s body, they proudly chant, <q>God is dead! Satan lives!</q> With their well-hidden operation, everyone in the group benefits from the leeway they obtain from generally believed truisms: the elderly do not mean harm, doctors mean well, and good-looking spouses ought to be trusted. It is their word against Rosemary’s: who would we believe on the witness stand? They are an indictment of society, showing us how we are part of the scheme that stole Rosemary’s agency. On multiple occasions, the retired neighbors poison Rosemary, the revered doctor uses his status to discredit Rosemary’s experience, and Guy sells out his wife for career advancement. Rosemary is a woman living in a man’s world where even the women side against themselves. The bias implicates us all, not even sparing those closest to us.</p>

                    <p>There is no <cite>Rosemary's Baby</cite> without the ending in the Castevet’s apartment that made me red with rage. For Rosemary’s sake, I wanted to run away with that baby and burn the place down. As a mother, Rosemary has no such option. She and her baby are  hostages to a bunch of Satanists, helpless to their plight, trapped in an endless cycle. Why do we never see her baby? Because in our imagination, the horror only grows. Over fifty-five years later, <cite>Rosemary's Baby</cite> is an essential story in showing us how we perceive the experiences of women. The film’s undercurrents make it a revolutionary movie for its time - and keep it so, so relevant today.</p>
