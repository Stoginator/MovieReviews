    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Spider-Man: Homecoming</cite> launches a fresh take on the character of Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) in the same world as the Avengers. </p>

                    <p>Our introduction to Peter is on through his "video diary" of being taken to meet Tony Stark. He's wonderstruck and excited - pretty much how I would be if I were in his shoes. That's the beginning of the film's development of Peter as a character and our relationship with him. It's not something unique to this film (or the other portrayals of Spider-Man), but founding this trait into Peter and the story is what sets this film apart.</p>

                    <p>We see Peter dread high school and trying to focus on his other life throughout the school day. Peter wants more responsibility, he has powers and wants to use them to help in a big way. In this world, what can be more helpful than becoming an Avenger? By grounding the story in Peter's daytime environment - high school - these ambitions become very relatable. Furthermore, the film treats Peter as a kid through the world he encompasses. His best friend, Ned, and Aunt May have no clue that Peter is your friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man. On top of that, Tony Stark poses the largest threat to his giant ambitions. In this way, Spider-Man becomes a dynamic character and further envelops us in his story.</p>

                    <p><cite>Homecoming</cite>'s story isn't anything to write home about. It feels as if it was there to further Peter's character by laying in the groundwork for a powerhouse sequel. But, that being said, the film still works very well and is painless to watch unfold because of the script's investment into the characters. The movie's villain, the Vulture, feels similar to other superhero villains with a different set of motives, yet Michael Keaton grounds the character. Without Keaton, it is likely the character would not have worked.</p>

                    <p>The film has the action that superhero films seem required to have, but where it shines is through the addition of Peter Parker's personal journey through high school. It is weird for a superhero movie to feel like a high school drama/comedy, but that is probably how Peter feels every step of the way. By the way, how did I not mention how funny this movie is?</p>
