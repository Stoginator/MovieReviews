    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>In <cite>The Brutalist</cite>, there is a wide shot of an architect sweeping dust off the floor. This is László Tóth. In just a few days of construction, László has led a team of immigrants to renovate a dimly lit room into a beautiful library. As the project nears completion, this new American immigrant toils over every detail by himself. The camera lingers as daylight diffuses through the white curtains, centering the man in his own creation.</p>

                    <p>Before this moment, I was not connecting to <cite>The Brutalist</cite>. But after, I found my first inroad. I related to László’s drive: that ferocious desire to achieve perfection on a tight deadline. How can you not respect such a talented artist as well as a boss who’s willing to dirty his own hands? These traits both belong to László, which endears us to him.</p>

                    <p>Like so many in the post-World War II immigration wave, László came to America locked inside the pitch black, steerage section of a passenger boat. For weeks, he endured a cramped, unsanitary environment - forking over what little money he had for a ticket. The first time he sees daylight, his boat arrives underneath the Statue of Liberty. Upon witnessing American majesty, his elation is contagious - like Jimmy Stewart's first steps into the Lincoln Memorial as the titular character in 1939’s <cite>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</cite>. László’s appreciation of simple things stays with you, long after the credits expire.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Brutalist</cite> sends us back to 1950s Americas with such authenticity that I asked myself, “How did they do that?”</p>

                    <p>For starters, the creative team decided to forgo digital cinematography. In its place, they resurrected a tool of the times, VistaVision, a film capture process that was used by John Ford in 1956’s <cite>The Searchers</cite> and Alfred Hitchcock in 1958’s <cite>Vertigo</cite> and 1959’s <cite>North by Northwest</cite>. Inherently because of what has been made on it, VistaVision carries both a sense of epic scale and the potential to show the intimate, inner life of characters. This is exactly what the story of <cite>The Brutalist</cite> demands. The grain pops have been left in its digital presentation, deliberately reminding the audience of the film’s origins. The sets, costumes, landscapes, and VistaVision fuse together to form a texture that feels very real.</p>

                    <p>To make a period drama like this, any Hollywood producer could look at the script and conclude, <q>This film is going to light a lot of money on fire.</q> Yet, the production team stretched ten million dollars across a three-and-a-half hour runtime - which is shockingly low by Hollywood standards. Again, how did they do that? Even with such limited resources, the triumph of <cite>The Brutalist</cite> is that writer-director Brady Corbet brought his vision to the screen so completely that, luckily, we don’t have to wonder about what could have been.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Brutalist</cite>’s enduring power comes from its central trio of characters. László is an architect of grand buildings in Hungary, made in the brutalist style. He has a difficult adjustment to America, where he has no funds, is an unknown talent, and misses his family. Through letters, he stays in touch with his wife, Erzsébet, who remains in Europe. As so many American success stories begin, László gets lucky, catching the attention of a wealthy patron, Mr. Van Buren, who enlists him to construct a sprawling worship center. To elevate the material, Corbet cast some of the world’s best actors in the three roles.</p>

                    <p>Adrien Brody plays László Tóth so believably that it feels like he is embodying the essence of a real person. Brody had no historical figure to study, so he invented László’s mannerisms with immense care: how he speaks, opens a lighter, and even walks. The actor’s attention to detail echoes his character’s approach to architectural work.</p>

                    <p>Then, for the role of Erzsébet, Corbet cast Felicity Jones, whose best-known work is in 2014’s The Theory of Everything and 2016’s Rogue One. As László is affected by the situations he encounters, his wife surprisingly plays his foil, standing as a measure of how much he has changed.</p>

                    <p>To round out the trio, Corbet signed a familiar face in cinema history, Guy Pierce, to play a wealthy investor who crosses paths with the couple. Pierce’s portrayal is alluring, a slow-burn of discovery. What lies beneath the surface of this man? With such an ensemble, Corbet lets the movie play, stretching a one-hundred-sixty page script to two-hundred fifteen minutes. The story of <cite>The Brutalist</cite> is what happens between them.</p>

                    <div class="spoilers">
                        <hr />
                        <p>Spoilers Ahead</p>
                        <hr />
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The idea for <cite>The Brutalist</cite> comes from a personal story. Corbet and his writing partner, Mona Fastvold, had a horrible experience making their previous film, 2018’s Vox Lux, securing funding from sketchy people. After its box-office failure, they endured a rocky, seven-year journey from the inception to the debut of this film. Because they are storytellers, they have no alternative but to return to the arena - no matter how brutal it may be.</p>
                    
                    <p>This begs the question: Why would Corbet and Fastvold transform their personal story set in modern-day Hollywood into a post-World War II film about an architect in Pennsylvania? It is because their ambitions are very bold; <cite>The Brutalist</cite>’s allegorical origins allow them to structure the film as a repudiation of the American Dream.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Brutalist</cite> is structured in two halves, separated by an intermission. The first half is largely set in the daytime. László feels proud of his immigrant experience, which is largely reinforced by the kind words of American citizens. Since he cannot find work as an architect, he copes as a functional heroin addict, living in a homeless shelter spending all his pay on the drug - which he was exposed to while in steerage.</p>

                    <p>One day, he is noticed by Mr. Van Buren, who invites him to his mansion. László’s talents impress the proprietor, who subsequently hires him to construct a grand worship center in the middle of town. A wealthy lawyer agrees to expedite Erzsébet’s immigration process. While there are emotional valleys, things largely go László’s way.</p>

                    <p>One day, he is noticed by Mr. Van Buren, who invites him to his mansion. László’s talents impress the proprietor, who subsequently hires him to construct a grand worship center in the middle of town. A wealthy lawyer agrees to expedite Erzsébet’s immigration process. While there are emotional valleys, things largely go László’s way.</p>
                    
                    <p>The audience can feel a sense of upward mobility - that László is now caught up in the propulsion of American industry. Vices creep in, but they feel peripheral to the experience like bus stops en route to the final destination. Erzsébet writes to László that she will reunite with him in America. If the film ended with the first half, <cite>The Brutalist</cite> would be a story of striving towards the American Dream.</p>

                    <p>When the intermission began, I stood up from my seat with a smile. I did not know what awaited me upon my return. The first half is engaging set-up, while the second half is the riveting pay-off.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the first time in years, László greets his wife, but the good feelings from their reunion are short-lived. László has limited mental space for his wife, as he has let his architectural endeavor - and his heroin addiction - consume him. While the couple enjoys moments together, he and Erzsébet begin to feel unwelcome as László accumulates more power as a successful architect. Their rise is somehow envied by people with more wealth.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Van Buren is someone who, most would say, achieved the American Dream. He owns a large property, with a mansion, servant quarters, guesthouses, luxury cars - and most of all, status. Van Buren is respected within his community and by his peers. But even someone with all of this wants more. <cite>The Brutalist</cite> takes us into his perspective, too, to show us that the chase for more never ends. But, when you have more money than you need, what else is left?</p>

                    <p>Scattered across the film, there are first-person images of a vehicle moving fast down a road or railroad track. Depending on the moment of viewing, the images spark different conversations. American prosperity is a great force. A single, onward march. The shots began with positive connotations, but as the events of the film became darker, the meaning of the rapid movement flipped. It is present in composer Daniel Blumberg’s thematic score: in <cite>Overture (Bus)</cite>, against a steady rhythm, you can hear the slightly off-tone notes in the background. The relentless pace of progress is built into the heart of America, but what does it cost us?</p>

                    <p>The version of László that we initially meet savors simple pleasures: to have a bed to sleep on, to do good work, and to enjoy with family. As he spends more time in America, he allows evil to seep into his life - doing things that he would have never done in his homeland. The vices that were once on the periphery start to becoming defining. László has become consumed by a heroin addiction, possessed by his artistic endeavors, and is chasing the image of success. He enjoys the perverse side of American culture.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Brutalist</cite> tears down the common myth that the American Dream means only one thing. In fact, the film argues that each level of the American Dream is increasingly less pure than the last.</p>
                    
                    <p>The film quickly registers the first level as the aspiration of immigrants who come here seeking a better life. Warm food, shelter, and the comfort of family provide the most meaning. This viewpoint is the presented well by the opening, one-shot in the darkness of steerage.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once people grow accustomed to basic necessities, they learn to see the world in terms of status, envious of the success of others. They pour their resources into raising their profile, by going into the “right” profession or acquiring certain items. This viewpoint is represented by Mr. Van Buren’s family and friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>When your status reigns supreme, your envy of others nags at you. But that envy has nowhere to go. There is nothing left to acquire, no professional accomplishment left to attain. In <cite>The Brutalist</cite>, only Mr. Van Buren has reached the third and final level. His envy manifests into the desire to control people, which is the ultimate subversion of freedom. Owning someone’s destiny is both part of the American Dream and antithetical to it.</p>
                    
                    <p>László and Erzsébet are tainted by American culture, caught up in a system that negatively affects their being. Erzsébet struggles to understand her husband after years of separation. One night in a daze, he medicates her with an injection of heroin - and she almost dies from an overdose.</p>
                    
                    <p>When she wakes up, Erzsébet finally understands her husband’s emotional distance. She sees a culture that has corroded her husband, almost to the point of no return. Drawn thin by his professional endeavors, making poor decisions due to substance abuse, and violated by his employer, she tells him that, <q>This place is rotten.</q></p>
                    
                    <p>The second half of <cite>The Brutalist</cite> deconstructs the American Dream as an <em>undesirable</em> feat. By depicting its final stage, Corbet undermines the American Dream as a societal illness where more is never enough - where the very culture is corrosive to the pure intentions of an artist.</p>
                    
                    <p>By the end of <cite>The Brutalist</cite>, Corbet leaves the audience with a strange feeling - that only arrives when a filmmaker tries to deconstruct one of our central beliefs. The American Dream is a fundamental reason for centuries of America’s success. Its mythology is central to the American identity, but what of its perverse conclusion? Do we worship status more than human dignity?</p>

                    <p>Corbet has crafted an American epic in the same fashion as the great films of the twentieth century - on large-format film stock, with a thematic score, featuring some of the best actors of our time. In <cite>The Brutalist</cite>, he takes huge swings at a central pillar of our society - not with malicious intent, but with the wisdom of a filmmaker to ask questions of us. His film will live for a long time: What will be our reply?</p>
