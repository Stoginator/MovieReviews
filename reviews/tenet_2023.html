    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>The impetus for 2023’s <cite>Oppenheimer</cite> came from 2020’s <cite>Tenet</cite>. In <cite>Tenet</cite>, a scientist from the future develops The Algorithm: a way to reverse the entropy of Earth (and likely the universe?). To our senses, it would reverse the flow of time and unleash catastrophic damage. The scientist has an “Oppenheimer moment” where she realizes her discovery could be used to destroy the world, so she breaks up the technology and scatters it in the vaults of the nine nuclear powers. On paper, the premise sounds so compelling, but in execution, <cite>Tenet</cite> falters. </p>

                    <p>Releasing in September 2020 during the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, few American moviegoers had the chance to see this on the big screen, yet it made an <em>insane</em> <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6723592/">365 million dollars</a> at the worldwide box office. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/TomCruise/status/1298336338434052096">Tom Cruise</a> showed up in support.</p>

                    <p>As for me, I have seen the film three times so far. The first viewing was on 4K Blu-Ray at the tail end of 2020. I was utterly confused by inversion, unaffected by the limited emotional entanglements of the story, and convinced this was Christopher Nolan’s first clunker. The second viewing was at a movie theater in August 2021. This time, I prepared my brain by watching an amazing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQ3pyngtYM">spoiler-free explanation of inversion</a>. Walking out of the theater, I was so happy to finally understand the principal mechanic of the film that I forgave anything else about it. I listened to the soundtrack and enjoyed my new state of mind. Now, on my third viewing two years later, I am not feeling so forgiving.</p>

                    <p><cite>Tenet</cite> is an example of stylistic excess. The two and a half hours of film is consistently loud, filling the space with huge low-end bangs (e.g. watch the 747 crash), a dominating score, and hard-to-catch dialogue. Exposition is presented to the point of overload; if you miss parts of the briefing for Stalsk-12 battle two hours in, the filmmakers’ answer seems to be: good luck! Without subtitles, my enjoyment of the film – on my third viewing! – would have been muted.</p>

                    <p>No one understands complexity in storytelling better than director Christopher Nolan; his chief and guiding wisdom is that complexity is a lever to increase audience engagement. Audiences want to be challenged. After rewatching <cite>Tenet</cite>, I now believe that complexity in storytelling follows the law of diminishing returns with respect to audience engagement. Too much complexity results in the audience’s complete and absolute surrender. For most people, including me, <cite>Tenet</cite> poorly crosses the complexity tipping point.</p>

                    <p>Yet, <cite>Tenet</cite> is also a response to that proposition. Nolan’s obvious answer is “I am comfortable asking audiences to rewatch <cite>Tenet</cite>.” It is a film built for repeat viewings to continue pulling more out of the experience. Unfortunately, <cite>Tenet</cite> is not a completely rosy picture in that sense either.</p>

                    <p>The only way to make 300 million dollars in box office during a pandemic is repeat business from high risk-taking moviegoers. Based on the only public moviegoing data available, those individuals felt <cite>Tenet</cite> had to be seen again. It is easy to see why: every set piece in the film is <em>impressive</em>, massive events that only Christopher Nolan and his team could hatch: the opening is thrilling, the 747 crash is ridiculous, the Freeport turnstile fight is awesome, the highway heist is jaw-dropping, and the Stalsk-12 temporal pincer is actually fun once the plan becomes clear. Stalsk-12 is a great technical achievement - assembling hundreds of actors in uniform running backwards in the middle of nowhere, while the camera films in reverse to make the world seem inverted; certainly, this is confusing on paper, but it feels magnificent on screen. I wish I had the opportunity to see this in IMAX. If the kid director from 2011's <cite>Super 8</cite> visited this set, he would be screaming, "Production value!"</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, <cite>Tenet</cite> adventures through about 80 minutes of typical spy thriller before our version of the Protagonist (John David Washington) goes into an inversion turnstile - which seems structurally weird. In those 80 minutes after the opening siege, <cite>Tenet</cite> introduces inversion with a wonderful explanation from Clémence Poésy and gets lost in plot. There is some cool action, a bit of needed humor from Neil (an excellent Robert Pattinson), an Indian arms dealer (Dimple Kapadia), and a broken, super-wealthy family which features yet another arms dealer.</p>

                    <p>At times, the plot (which is not helped by hard-to-hear dialogue) feels more complicated than the chief mechanic. Plot complexity added on top of the complexity of inversion makes the audience throw up their hands and say: “What the hell?” Too many movies nowadays are leaning on the old-fashioned “the world is going to end unless X, Y, Z” plot. Audiences are building resistance to it being used as an inroad to make them care. Being devoid of any real emotional strands, <cite>Tenet</cite>'s plot fails the movie’s spectacular mechanics.</p>

                    <p>During my third viewing, I was waiting to arrive at the point where our version of the Protagonist inverts himself. 2010’s <cite>Inception</cite> introduced the induced-dreaming mechanic from the beginning and built up our understanding scene-by-scene – with an emotional hook from the get-go. None of it is as emotionally fitting as Cobb’s story from <cite>Inception</cite>. Moreover, none of it helps our understanding of the mechanic; it is a lost opportunity to make <cite>Tenet</cite> more watchable in the moment and rewatchable for posterity.</p>

                    <p>I want to shoutout the music by Ludwig Göransson because it is extremely unique. Its presence in the mind grows quickly; pretty soon, I am hearing the rumbles halfway through <cite>MEETING NEIL</cite>. In particular, <cite>RAINY NIGHT IN TALLINN</cite>, <cite>FREEPORT</cite>, <cite>TRUCKS IN PLACE</cite>, and <cite>THE PROTAGONIST</cite> are my favorite tunes. Seriously, try them out on a run if you want to break the sound barrier. I really do not understand why the capital letters are crucial, but I am sure there is a good reason. Although, listening to it in a car resulted in an annoyed passenger and a quip: "What are these annoying noises? Is this even music?" Beware: you could wake up the neighbors or frighten the pets.</p>

                    <p>It feels like Nolan has much affinity for inversion. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbO6X_aCxDE">ending of the film</a> makes it easy to see him revisiting this concept and the world. The potential for more is evident. You can hear it in some of Neil's last lines - which are wonderful in context:</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">"‘What’s happened happened’ – which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.”</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“You have a future in the past.”</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">“For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Neil and the Protagonist have a gravity together; I was drawn into every two-shot with them. A new entry exploring the friendship yet to come would be another opportunity to focus an entire film on the mechanics of time inversion and build out a satisfying emotional arc. How does the Protagonist change into the time inversion genius that plans the big-picture temporal pincer? Can someone make an emotional connection in the past that they cannot take with them into the future? For example, could you fall in love and then never be able to live out that love because you are from two different times? Where do Neil and the Protagonist go next? Finding a way to end the next film at the beginning of their friendship sounds awesome. Possibilities abound in the world of <cite>Tenet</cite>.</p>

                    <p>There is an extraordinary movie to be made here, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

                    <p>P.S. Does Christopher Nolan have a soft spot for 2005's <cite>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</cite>? He cast Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) in the same movie.
