    				<p>A few days after I watched 2015’s <cite>The Revenant</cite>, I visited Lassen Volcanic National park. I stood on the edge of a lake with a beautiful view of Lassen Peak. In the natural silence, the only constant was the voice inside my head.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>It was a pleasant day — until a burst of wind froze me in my steps. This was summertime. I imagined having to deal with a winter here. With fresh eyes, I looked around and wondered about the history of this place.</p>

                    <p>I had many questions: Who used to live on these lands? How did they survive the forces of nature? What was the source of meaning in their lives? In those times, what did they aspire to?</p>

                    <p>That’s when I understood: <cite>The Revenant</cite> is an access point to one of these stories. While its story is historical fiction, the filmmakers have preserved the truth in the characters’ actions. Their choices are of a certain era. In the dead of the night, can you imagine your hands trembling from the frost as you summon all your strength to crawl up a snow-covered hill? Your goal is the only good meal you’ve had in days: raw bison meat. Modern civilization, with all its plenty, does not confront these circumstances.</p>

                    <p>My experience in a national park lit a fuse, clueing me in to <cite>The Revenant</cite>'s central, unspoken themes: When confronted by the fierce forces of Mother Nature, you must reckon with your own mortality in every moment. In those times of silent fear, what becomes the sum of your life? Was it possible to live a life of meaning in the wild? In the wilderness, these are the questions that we ponder.</p>

                    <p>After basking in the silence of an American national park, I gained a deeper appreciation for the film’s depiction of survival and journey towards meaning. To survive in the wild, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) desperately clings to the strongest sense of purpose he can find. Clawing for every breath — that is the only way forward.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p><cite>The Revenant</cite> opens with a prologue, illustrating the meaning in Hugh Glass’s life. As an American settler living on the frontier, Glass lives with a Pawnee woman and their son, Hawk. Their village, nestled in an idyllic valley, is distant from the biases of other frontiersmen who would view Glass’s familial choices as a betrayal.</p>
               </section>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Unfortunately, Glass can’t run far enough from those men. One day, their village is burned down by American soldiers, looking to clear the land. They systematically search the homes. In the scourge, Glass’s wife is murdered. Driven by vengeance, Glass kills an American lieutenant.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Some Years Later</blockquote>

                    <p>To stay afloat, Glass and his now teenage son, Hawk, become fur trappers. Their employer pays them to collect beaver pelts, a luxury item for upper class Americans that made fur trapping a lucrative job.</p>

                    <p>Today, we understand that fur trappers decimated the beaver population. For the men of the era, however, the occupation was a way of survival in an unforgiving world. <cite>The Revenant</cite> refuses to romanticize or condemn the experience of living on the frontier. Rather, the brutality of the historical American West is presented as close to the truth as possible.</p>

                    <p>Lawlessness pervaded the land. Frontiersmen pillaged the forests and refused to honor Native Americans’ land claims — who did not sit idly. They fought against infringements on their homes. All this was complicated by harsh winters which brought frontiersmen, Natives, and animals further into conflict with each other. Survival in these conditions demanded extraordinary sacrifice. Finding meaning in this land was almost impossible.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Yet, Glass’s greatest obstacle goes by the name of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). A member of Glass’s fur trapping company, he represents the lowest common denominator of frontiersman — harboring great prejudice against the Natives and concerned only with self-preservation. To Fitzgerald, honor is negotiable in the presence of greater wealth or longer survival.</p>

                    <p>Glass and Fitzgerald’s conflict begins after an attack on their camp by Natives, causing a massive loss of pelts. Fitzgerald directs his fury towards Glass and his “half-breed son.” Glass refuses to react, but Hawk seethes — almost giving Fitzgerald the scapegoat he wants. Glass scolds his son in his mother’s tongue of Arikara:</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">GLASS</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">(They don’t hear your voice! They just see the color of your face… Do you understand?)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As this conflict festers, Glass is almost mauled to death in a bear attack. The gashes are deep.</p>

                    <p>It is wintertime now. Unable to move him, the company offers payment to anyone who will stay behind to tend to his wounds. Of all the members, Fitzgerald volunteers. His greed is thinly veiled, but he now faces another choice: Save Glass or leave him for dead. But there’s another wrinkle: What about Glass’s boy, Hawk?</p>

                    <p>Fitzgerald’s calculus is simple. When the company is days away, Glass dies. As for his boy, if he protests, he dies, too. No one will be the wiser. Fitzgerald stabs Hawk to death and buries Glass alive.</p>
               </section>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>From the comfort of a movie theater, Fitzgerald’s actions are heinous and cruel. Yet, I remembered my time in the national park: The wind on a cool summer day stopped me in my tracks. If the piercing spikes of Mother Nature’s winter wind touched my skin in that era, what would I have done? Would I have been more righteous?</p>

                    <p>In the quiet after Fitzgerald’s murders, the arc of <cite>The Revenant</cite> begins. With his wounds, Glass is at the lowest point in his life. Unable to retaliate, he is left for dead, with no friendly civilization nearby. He is completely isolated — facing the triple-threat of other frontiersmen, Native Americans, and Mother Nature. They have all marked him already. Will they do it one last time?</p>

                    <p>Yet, these are all external characteristics. With the loss of Hawk, the greatest meaning in his life has been erased from the earth. This demolition of purpose happened once already. Somehow, Glass rebuilt himself from the rubble. Choice-by-choice, minute-by-minute, will Glass survive his internal turmoil? In the silence, what will give him meaning?</p>

                    <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4QrLwgJt0OGkUFBbQKk0fL">Ryuichi Sakamoto’s main theme</a> is interspersed with silence, which is the first thing I noticed about America’s national parks. When you stand upon a vista or inside a forest, there is a palpable vacuum. Without the force of wind, there is nothing to save you from your thoughts.</p>

                    <p>Walking next to rivers and mountains, it made me wonder: How did Glass — and people for thousands of years — survive in this world? Don’t you find it remarkable that our civilization made it so far?</p>

                    <p>When these frontiersmen waded through these lands, their journey was a battle for meaning. In Hugh Glass’s quiet moments in the elements, you sense his inner battle. Any step could be his last, if he wanted it to be.</p>

                    <p>Sakamoto’s theme captures this quest for meaning. If the silence is considered the default mode, the strong bursts of orchestra are brief outpourings of emotions. Meaning comes in waves.</p>

                    <p>To keep clawing for breath, Glass builds a new foundation of meaning: Vengeance. In the winter west, Glass vows to find Fitzgerald and erase <em>him</em> from the earth. He draws upon vengeance to renew his physical body and his spirit.</p>

                    <p>Glass tends to his own wounds, enduring tremendous pain to cauterize his wide-open gashes. He is relentless in healing himself. He must find his strength again. He knows he will confront opposing sources of meaning — facing the freezing cold, the lawlessness of the land, and eventually Fitzgerald.</p>

                    <p>Every frame of <cite>The Revenant</cite> reveals a landscape — whether it’s the intimate human face, a parting of forest trees, or a sprawling vista. The filmmakers understood that Mother Nature was the core of <cite>The Revenant</cite>. No studio set or backlot production could match the authenticity of actors and crew in real locations. The audience can feel the intensity because it’s all there in camera.</p>

                    <p>Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inñaritú and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki shot on location in only natural light, painstakingly rehearsing long one-shots to hit all their spots. For each shot, the proper amount of sunlight was only available for one or two hours a day. One mistake from any department could set everyone back.</p>

                    <p>The production team braved the elements to recreate the story in its actual environment. You’ll find breath mist and lens moisture abound in certain sequences. With their combined skill, the artistic integrity of the film was not diminished. Out there, they captured something that shooting in air-conditioned sets in Los Angeles never would have.</p>

                    <p>After venturing across the wilderness, Glass’s epic journey reaches its destination. He finds Fitzgerald, who is secretly afraid of meeting his ghost, not a man in the flesh. <em>How could someone return from death’s door?</em> To Fitzgerald, a man who only knows greed, the answer could only be resurrection.</p>

                    <p>In a game of cat and mouse, Glass pushes Fitzgerald to the frozen edges of a creek, where a violent battles ensues. Both men impale the other, but Fitzgerald loses his strength. Glass’s meaning system of vengeance is greater than one of greed.</p>

                    <p>But Glass doesn’t deliver the final blow. He sees a group of Native Americans downstream and decides:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">GLASS</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">(Revenge is in God's hands. Not mine.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>He passes a bleeding Fitzgerald down the creek, where Native Americans place the final stake. Glass is heavily wounded, but he’s been here before. Shivering in a winter storm, with open wounds, a winter gust hits his chest as he ponders the existential questions.</p>

                    <p>In the film’s final shots, Glass collapses into the snow as he confronts death’s door. He claws for breath. <cite>The Revenant</cite>’s main theme plays. In real time, his will to endure is changing. He looks up to find his wife’s ghost. She offers a generous smile, as if to say, “Come.”</p>

                    <p>His grief will never pass. Nothing will restore the loss of a wife and son. Soon, the emptiness will creep back into his body. It will compel him to give up against the opposing forces of meaning. Yet, against all odds, he saved himself from the brink once before. He knows these feelings, even if it doesn’t make it any easier.</p>

                    <p>Looking into camera, Glass sits at a crossroads of existence, silently asking himself: <em>Who am I?</em> </p>
                </section>

                    <p>Father no longer. Husband no more. The totality of his journey — recovering from a grizzly bear attack, braving winter hell, and avenging his family — is overwhelming. The blood debt has been paid and his previous meaning system is shattered. Can he forge a new one?</p>

                    <p>Alejandro Gonzalez Inñaritú, the great Chilango director, refuses to answer. The sound of Glass’s breath, which opened the film, runs into the end credits and fades away. Some may construe this as Glass’s death, but no such event occurs onscreen.</p>

                    <p>To me, his final look encapsulates the end of one journey, but not the end of his full story. How so? At the beginning of <cite>The Revenant</cite>, Glass whispers to his son in the language, Arikara. In the native tongue, the sound is poetic and musical.</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">GLASS</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">(It’s okay, son. I know you want this to be over. I’m right here. I will be right here. But, you don’t give up. You hear me? As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe… keep breathing.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This was the mantra that Glass lived by. The revenant — the ultimate underdog — will always find a reason to keep clawing for breath.</p>
