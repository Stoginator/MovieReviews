    				<p>Sequels are difficult propositions. The audience knows the world; what next story is compelling enough that they will enjoy it more than the first? Many valiant attempts have crashed and burned. You know the ones you did not like.</p>

                    <p>However, prequels are notoriously trickier to do well. In the last twenty years of cinema, the luster of franchises has projected more prequels on the silver screen than any other era. Some of the most prominent are 2012’s <cite>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</cite>, 2013’s <cite>Monsters University</cite>, 2016’s <cite>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</cite>, 2016’s <cite>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</cite> (a horrible title for a <cite>Harry Potter</cite> prequel), and 2024’s <cite>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</cite>. The audience knows exactly where the story has gone, so how do the filmmakers make it engaging? For twenty years, audiences have hoped – and been rarely rewarded. Moviegoers and our filmmakers have repeatedly shared the same lesson: The past is almost always less ripe than the future.</p>

                    <p><cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> faced great odds to buck the trend. Could it introduce compelling relationships, teach us something new about its world, and ultimately engross us? No. As the credits rolled, I wondered how Paramount Pictures green-lit such a vapid film, one that bores and feels completely inessential to the superb franchise in its name.</p>

                    <p>This prequel’s first strike occurs two minutes into the film. Sitting among many elderly patients in hospice care, the protagonist, a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong’o), is asked to read a poem aloud during group therapy. She tritely begins, <q>Everything is shit.</q> She continues to criticize every mundane detail around her: <q>This place is shit,</q> <q>This activity is shit,</q> <q>Everything is shit.</q> For a poet, it’s not very articulate. For a multi-million-dollar film, it makes me wonder how this kind of glib writing that ever made it to the screen. I empathized with the poor souls in the room listening to the same garbage. I pity the poor editor who had to watch every camera angle captured in that scene. Did anyone from Paramount Pictures even read past the title page? How is this horrid scene allowed open the film? Instead of endearing us to the main character, the weak exposition of <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> creates distance.</p>

                    <p>The premise of <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> is exciting because of its scale. We have seen the aliens land - just not in New York City.  As I have learned in big-budget films of late, scale becomes stale. Intimate relationships are the lifeblood of a story – and <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> deprives the audience of the two best candidates, in quick succession, before it feels emotionally justified. After losing our investment twice, we are forced to settle the third time – which falls flat in comparison.</p>

                    <p>There is a dramatic irony throughout <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> that makes the tension unsatisfying. In 2021’s <cite>A Quiet Place Part II</cite>, the characters and the audience learn how to harm the alien invaders – and finally take back the advantage. However, none of the New Yorkers ever learn this. While it is understandable, it becomes dramatic irritation. The story never catches up to our understanding of how to fight. Witnesses New Yorkers under attack is initially scary. Soon after, it becomes excruciating. If the audience knows more than the characters for the entire movie, it is hard to care about their problems.</p>

                    <p>To paraphrase Steven Spielberg talking about his 1975 film, <cite>Jaws</cite>: <q>You only get one jump scare in a film. And once you use it, the audience is always looking for the next one.</q> <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> uses its jump scare moment too early – and spends the rest of the movie trying to recreate the suspense. Because we know what is coming, we scan the frame and listen closely. Given how the characters must use silence to avoid attracting aliens, the intensity of no dialogue becomes exhausting. Every time the movie goes silent, we await a jump scare because that is mainly how this film tries to terrify us. After a while, it becomes easier to tune out from the film.</p>

                    <p>I left the theater wondering, <q>What was the purpose of adding this story to the pantheon?</q> Except for using the super-hearing aliens from the previous films, <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> adds nothing new to the franchise. The filmmakers reduced a great concept into a generic disaster film – which still pales in comparison to any of its predecessors and 2008’s <cite>Cloverfield</cite>, an original disaster film set in New York City, which all set the bar high. Rather than retread plot points in an existing franchise, <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> should have strived to be fresh and imaginative as an original film. We can dream, but, in Hollywood, the guaranteed dollars always win.</p>

                    <p><cite>A Quiet Place</cite> and <cite>A Quiet Place: Part II</cite> are memorable because the stories contrast a collapsed world and the unfailing expression of familial love within it. Even after the apocalypse, the bond between parents and their children holds. Given the precedent, I patiently gave <cite>A Quiet Place: Day One</cite> a chance to redeem itself with a quality ending. It was memorable, but only because I was relieved to finally exit stage right. The prequel curse has not been broken with this one.</p>
