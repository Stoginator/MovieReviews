    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>It's hard to describe the experience of watching this film. It's harrowing, tense, and even shell-shocking. Christopher Nolan has put the audience on the beaches of Dunkirk, on the fishing boats, and into the spitfires during the greatest evacuation of World War II.</p>

                    <p>Only the most talented directors can sustain tension. An audience cannot be stressed for two hours unless the story being told is engrossing. It must capture the audience. <cite>Dunkirk</cite> needs almost no exposition - it is told by a single piece of paper. From there, <cite>Dunkirk</cite> explodes and the film's tension and suspense begin.</p>

                    <p>The film follows the evacuation of 300,000 men from three distinct perspectives - a genius move by Nolan. There is Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a young boy who represents the everyman trying to find a way to escape the beaches of Dunkirk. Next, the film follows actor Mark Rylance playing a fisherman going into war to transport survivors back to the mainland. In the air, the film tracks Farrier (Tom Hardy) trying to counteract the Nazi bombers and protect the English Channel. Nolan crosscuts between these three perspectives allowing him to tell the story nonlinearly - and skyrocket the tension.</p>

                    <p>Everything Nolan does in the film allows him to up the tension. From depicting the conflict from land, air, and sea to having a ticking clock in the background for most of the film, Nolan mastered the technique of suspense. Capturing the audience with his use of IMAX cameras to fill up the large screen, Nolan transports you. And when there is a Nazi bomber plane flying overhead, you hear it coming closer until it becomes deafening. Nolan takes away our ability to focus on any one thing.</p>

                    <p>Nolan also accomplished a feat which I have taken for granted - spontaneity. There is a jump scare early in the film - so I thought that must be it - but I found myself startled across the entirety of the film. Nolan constantly reminds the audience that war is unpredictable. In this, Nolan shows us the realities of war - the fear of being killed at any time and the mental toll that takes.</p>

                    <p><cite>Dunkirk</cite> represents a significant accomplishment for films. It's uncommon for a film to grip you and sustain that - but it's much rarer for a film to transport you. And transporting an audience into the midst of the Dunkirk evacuation is a big ask. <cite>Dunkirk</cite> is as remarkable as a film as it is a story. This film is one of the greatest experiences in a cinema that I ever had.</p>
