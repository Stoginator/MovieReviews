    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>1979’s <cite>Kramer vs. Kramer</cite> is about the dissolution of a marriage and how two people deal with such a circumstance. The opening scenes struck me as a masterpiece of characterization through action, showing us the buildup of years of marriage and its dissolution all in the span of ten minutes. There is no montage, no flashbacks, only action in the present. How do you convey the gravity of the moment and show us why it happened - so the audience can empathize with both characters. Done incorrectly, the audience would not respect Joanna’s decision to leave her son even though she was in an inadequate relationship. The scene answers our doubts: "Why can’t she talk it out?”</p>

                    <p>In a heavy state of depression, Joanna (Meryl Streep) painstakingly makes the best decision for herself, thinking “Do I have to leave my son to finally feel understood?” The most impressive guy at work, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) charms his boss with a story about buying a Burberry coat, checking his watch to realize he is at work far too late into the night. The scene cuts before we hear the finish of his story because it doesn’t matter. Just like every other night for the last seven years, Ted overworks. Tonight however, it finally pays off because his boss gives him the esteemed Mid-Atlantic account. At the highest point of his professional career, Ted is about to meet his wife at the lowest point of her life. Director Robert Benton features <a href="https://youtu.be/qgoY14w8uqY?si=RKbstevRYgVfYMhD&t=284">a duo playing guitar on the street</a> whose charming music contrasts with a dreadful situation, alleviating some of the pressure in the mood of the scene. It is a brace for impact because this troubled couple is about to meet.</p>

                    <p>After Joanna opens the door to their apartment, Ted barges in with a ceremonial kiss and dominates any conversation. Joanna meekly listens, relegated to her usual position, but building confidence to actually do something. Joanna says the most difficult statement of her life, <q>I’m leaving you,</q> and Ted is so focused on making a work call that he doesn’t even hear her. For Joanna, that sealed the deal. She explains what she is leaving behind; Ted does not like the joke, resorting to <q>Boy, you really pick your times to…</q> insinuating that he cannot believe his wife is walking out the day before the biggest presentation of his life.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>As Joanna escapes the apartment, Benton keeps both actors in frame with a medium shot, letting us edit the scene in our minds, swapping which subject to focus on. Joanna taps the elevator button. Inside of seconds, Ted’s body language switches from pissed off to reassuring to helpless. Joanna is freaking out, unable to take a full breath, until the elevator finally arrives. Joanna rushes into the corner, in disbelief of the words she is saying, but knowing she has to go. As the elevator door closes, any hope of restoration dissolves, and the marriage is over.</p>

                    <p>Because of this powerful opening scene, the rest of the film is about two people forced to embark on journeys of significant growth separately. <cite>Kramer vs. Kramer</cite> strikes me as a great title for marketing purposes, and it subverts the audience’s expectations for what to expect. However, this is much more a tale of two parents versus the myths that society forces upon them. One fiction is that all fathers are the primary breadwinners for their household, and need hollow, placeholder wives to support their life at home. The other is about how mothers are expected to stay at home and automatically earn the coveted “best parent” award. Ted and Joanna fall through the cracks of these ideas, briefly fitting them at the start of the film, and then never again.</p>

                    <p>As Ted becomes a better parent, learning how to make French toast, be on time for school, and give his son greater priority, he sees an equal punishment from his boss at work. To care for his son, Ted cannot be the amazing partner he once was. In order to work on herself, Joanna causes her son a great deal of pain. Seeing Billy (Justin Henry), just a young boy, suffer through a bout of depression because his mother was not coming back is emotional stuff. In this moment, Joanna cannot be the great mother that society expects. These myths broke their relationship and kept their son from knowing the depth of love that both of his parents could provide.</p>

                    <p>As a viewer, it feels like an impossible task to pick a side. For starters, the casting makes it difficult to empathize more with only <em>one</em> of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, two of the greatest actors of their generation. Even though the protagonist of the film is Ted, the film itself is impartial, placing these characters not at odds with each other, but society.</p>

                    <p>Because of how custody is adjudicated, they are forced to take the stand against each other in a court with divorce attorneys grilling them and eating half their salary. Accidents are nitpicked to create a misleading view of a parent. Divorce cases are unfair and grueling. Because <cite>Kramer vs. Kramer</cite> skillfully builds our empathy for both parents, we feel the blows from all sides. The whole sequence is quite draining.</p>

                    <p>Still, I am not sure how to process the open ending. The elevator scene that sealed the dissolution of a marriage is flipped to show us a glimmer of hope for recovery.  Joanna listens to Ted’s opinion, with a voice of her own. A more committed father, Ted gracefully lets Joanna see her son alone. Both of these people are in better places, more equipped to lead a fulfilling relationship for Billy. To quote Alan Arkin in 2012’s <cite>Argo</cite>, <q>Kids need the mother.</q> Will it happen? I really hope so.</p>
