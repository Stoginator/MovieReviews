    				<p>The most valuable skill in drama may be how a writer withholds information, letting the audience fill the void with their own assumptions. The information is always present, but we don’t have the right lens to see it - and we are shocked when we learn the full story.</p>

                    <p>This is a concept that <cite>Companion</cite> has mastered. I am awed by how often this film reframed what I assumed to be true. The story moves so quickly that there is no time to think ahead. We’re too busy reacting to the current events.</p>

                    <p><cite>Companion</cite> is a film best viewed without much knowledge about it. The premise is cliché: a group of friends arrive at a weekend getaway. Luckily, I knew nothing else about the film other than its reputation. Whatever my expectations for the story were, <cite>Companion</cite> goes somewhere far more interesting. It is a prescient, original film with equal measures of comedy and human drama.</p>

                    <p>I left the theater with my head spinning, while feeling thoroughly entertained.</p>
                <div class="spoilers">
                    <hr />
                    <p>Spoilers Ahead</p>
                    <hr />
                </div>
                    <p>The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/19L8nDWiUjd3KOCCjJWF3G"> main theme</a> of <cite>Companion</cite> is inspired by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0UyifotZndmtNsgBAggdnT">a lullaby in a sister film</a>, 1968’s <cite>Rosemary’s Baby</cite>. Both films feature a female protagonist, trapped in a conspiracy they must escape from. The leading women have been robbed of their agency, subject to the whims of conniving “friends.” In both films, my reaction to the escalating tension was “Is this really happening?”</p>

                    <p>Iris (Sophie Thatcher) is enamored with her boyfriend, Josh (Jack Quaid). She feels like her whole life led to the moment where they first met. This is true, though not in the way we assumed.</p>

                    <p><cite>Companion</cite> offers an elegant twist on the proceedings: what if the protagonist, Iris, has a reversal of identity? That she is not a human with memories, but a robot manufactured to provide sensual pleasures to its owner. To enrich himself, her beloved, Josh, has devised a plan to frame her for murder.</p>

                    <p>The realization is a brilliant set-up, as we have grown accustomed to Iris’s humanity. Suddenly, we are forced to confront her inhumanity - and wonder whether she may be more human than her own boyfriend.</p>

                    <p>Among the supporting cast, these reversals of identity appear again and again, changing the dynamics between this group of friends every time. Who is who? What is what? Assumptions are dangerous in this story.</p>

                    <p>With <cite>Companion</cite>, I see a growing body of work in Hollywood about the anxieties of living in the digital age. Just like in 2014’s <cite>Ex Machina</cite> or 2023’s <cite>The Creator</cite>, these stories present more humanity in these robots than we initially accept when having abstract conversations about the future. These robots are made in our image. They reflect our own design back at us - but never our tendency to be cruel. I imagine the film was pitched to financiers as <cite>Rosemary’s Baby</cite> meets <cite>The Terminator</cite>, where a robot Rosemary is pursued by human terminators.</p>

                    <p>I was also surprised by how technologically sound the script is; the filmmakers clearly did their research with hardware and software experts. When one robot (Lukas Gage) is reset to its factory settings, its memory store is assumed to be deleted. Later, an environmental trigger causes the robot to discover memories that were thought to be lost.</p>

                    <p>While the technology behind <cite>Companion</cite>’s robots is peripheral to the story, this is a true phenomenon with solid-state hard drives (SSDs), which the robots surely used. For example, when you delete files off of an SSD, more space is available for the user. However, those files are not truly lost until new data overwrites the original space. Security researchers exploit this fact to uncover “deleted” files.</p>

                    <p>Another lesson within <cite>Companion</cite>: Never underestimate the reach of new technologies when applied to romance. The first, widespread applications of high-definition video and virtual reality were in X-rated videos. Now, digital romantic partners are an emerging practice, using chatbots and text conversations as the primary medium. For some, text conversations with digital personas are filling in for friends.</p>

                    <p>As <cite>Companion</cite> demonstrates, this desire for digital mates will become more intense. While affordable, humanoid robot partners may be decades away, don’t be surprised if we advance from text conversations with chatbots to full-on, FaceTime calls with digitally created people, who express a full range of facial expressions and intonation. Most likely, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDKaoUNLNLc">the social stigma around these interactions will evaporate</a>.</p>

                    <p>At Iris’s level of emotional complexity, humans can no longer physically distinguish between organic and inorganic versions of themselves. We have to ask: are these humanoid robots deserving of equal rights? What happens when Iris takes the stand at a Supreme Court hearing - making the case for her constitutional rights? As humans yearn to be free, so follow robots.</p>

                    <p>That’s the emotional magic of <cite>Companion</cite>. In one sitting, our perspective is reversed: we see Iris, the robot, as more like us than her human captors.</p>
