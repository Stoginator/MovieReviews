    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>2022’s <cite>Smile</cite> was a surprise, a fresh concept in the horror genre that was well executed. Word of mouth spread quickly, leading to packed shows throughout October. I had the pleasure of watching it in a sold-out auditorium – and relishing the crowd’s reactions. My friends were viewing the film through the slits between their fingers. After the show, they were indignant about me. They said, <q>You were leaning forward in your seat, staring straight at the screen, and smiling!</q> Glancing at me in the middle of the film, they probably thought I was possessed by a demon.</p>

                    <p>The film’s box-office was a spectacular 12x return, grossing $217 million on a $17 million budget. The street wanted more. If the writer-director Parker Finn had a sequel to make, he had an easy greenlight from Paramount Pictures. Creatively speaking, he had a tougher ask: How do you use the same concept, make it interesting, and leave us satisfied again?</p>

                    <p><cite>Smile 2</cite> presents the life of a superstar, Skye Riley. She rehearses in empty stadiums, engages with adoring fans who huddle around every corner, and guzzles an unlimited supply of premium Voss water. Her entourage is chauffeured around in a blacked-out Cadillac Escalade. Alongside the film, the studio released <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/53i6qzqYuhIhcpVTVu0dW3?si=-ofvupdKQOmVQo9m6IfI_A">the Skye Riley EP</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Scott">Naomi Scott</a>, the actress playing Riley, providing the vocals. The song, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6AZKGzo7w2FPZ3Y8T4XjfQ?si=4d23081b89054033"><cite>Death of Me</cite></a>, is a banger! </p>

                    <p>In terms of appearance and style of music, Riley feels inspired by Dua Lipa. The details in Skye Riley’s world feel convincing. Aside from her personal life, she does not have a single hardship to complain about. Before her arrival, everything is meticulously prepared to her exact liking. In her presence, everyone wants to please her. When she leaves, everyone gushes that Skye Riley was just there. In a way, Riley’s superstardom removes all the friction from life. An aide prepares her schedule, a manager handles her contracts, but she still has the hardest job: perform.</p>

                    <p>Because so many people want to see the Skye Riley, she feels the pressure to always be at her best. Parker Finn spends much of <cite>Smile 2</cite> observing Skye Riley, which dulls the pace of the film. However, it is necessary. While observing the superstar, we understand that, behind the sheen, she is an ordinary person who wants to run away from a sense of constant judgement. Finn offers a commentary on the personal struggles of superstars and capitalizes on an opportunity to make the horror more painful – because we care.</p>

                    <p>Continuing after the events of the first film, <cite>Smile 2</cite> reinvigorates the tale with an intense subjective perspective. Almost every scene is filmed from Skye Riley’s point of view. Due to brand recognition, Parker Finn had to name the film <cite>Smile 2</cite>, but it really should have been <em>Skye Riley</em>. The film is consumed by her experiences: how she deals with personal trauma publicly, her exhaustion of always being fan ready, and the expectation of perfection. Even a young, beloved multi-millionaire artist can have an inferiority complex.</p>

                    <p>How do you spend two hours of a film inside someone’s mind? You can’t put a camera in there, but it is possible to make the audience feel the same as the character. The cinematic language that locks us into Skye Riley’s perspective is heavily inspired by 2023’s <cite>Oppenheimer</cite>, which goes inside the mind of the titular scientist and presents the critical events of his life without fear or favor. Using the same tools, Finn endeavors to do the same for Skye Riley.</p>

                    <p>The sound mix is visceral. Throughout the film, the volume of environmental effects is heightened. A window shattering, a car idling, and the slam of free weights are <em>loud</em>. In particular, the thumps of bass during Skye Riley’s rehearsals can be felt in your chest. Amplifying certain elements in the soundstage contributes to an ominous mood. When Finn transitions out of the dramatic observation of Skye Riley to set up the horror, the mix becomes doubly effective. By setting up the rules before anything happens, the menacing feeling teaches us an important lesson: No situation is safe.</p>

                    <p>Naomi Scott offers a commanding performance, displaying the entire arc of the film on her face. It is terrific work that, in any other genre, would be award-worthy. Finn tends to present Riley in a close-up, which has a dual purpose in <cite>Smile 2</cite>. The close-ups center the audience on her emotional experience – and offer a chance to hide the surroundings for the next jump scare.</p>

                    <p>Like all victims of Smile’s demonic parasite, Riley has a complicated past of open wounds and unevaluated trauma. Her fortitude in herself is weak. However, there are flashes of hope that she is a redeemable person. That is the promise that <cite>Smile 2</cite> is built on.</p>

                    <p><cite>Smile 2</cite> is an escalating staircase of tension. Starting off with a remarkable opening, I leaned into this film. Finn delivers a captivating journey, with the tension in his story rising like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY">Shepard Tone</a>, a sound that feels like it can ascend in pitch forever. Eventually though, the film demands a fitting conclusion that halts the tone. That is why it is unfortunate that the ending of <cite>Smile 2</cite> is unsatisfying.</p>

                    <p>When the final shot of <cite>Smile 2</cite> went dark, I thought, <q>There’s no way that is how it ends.</q> I was wrong. Finn wrote himself into a narrative trap: How do you successfully get off an escalating staircase? It is difficult, but it has been done before. While the rest of the experience met a high standard, Finn’s ending is a disappointment. Clearly, the series has been infected by sequel-itis, where narrative cohesion shrinks in importance compared to setting up the next film, <cite>Smile 3</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Finn rejects a core expectation that he builds in the audience. So much is reversed in the final minutes. The audience’s sense of structure is suddenly burned. The impactful arc of change that we were promised is voided. Nothing remains, except a potential plot introduced for a third film – which is admittedly exciting. Rather than centering on a single character, imagine a <cite>Smile</cite> film with multiple protagonists at the helm.</p>

                    <p>However, the sequel bait comes at a great cost. After the adrenaline of the experience wears off, the audience feels cheated by a hollow, disconnected ending. It is an immature decision, one that sucks all enjoyment from repeat viewings and nullifies larger box-office aspirations. At its current pace, <cite>Smile 2</cite> will be fortunate to make half the gross of the original – an undesirable outcome for a sequel with almost double the budget. The ending is a large reason why.</p>

                    <p>A principle among filmmakers is to never expect to be making a sequel in a few years. That forces you to make the current film as good as it can be – without regard to a character’s fate or a universe-changing story choice. <cite>Smile 2</cite> violated that principle. Even if a sequel is made, will there any goodwill left for the series? Instead of cementing the film in a small group of great sequels with a home-run ending, <cite>Smile 2</cite>’s legacy will be as a cinematic sacrifice.</p>
