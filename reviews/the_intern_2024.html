    				<p>Some characters onscreen are so good-natured that you wish you could meet them. The main character in 2015’s <cite>The Intern</cite>, Ben Whitaker, fits that iconic mold, with a presence that completely inhabits the work – like Robin Williams does in 1993’s <cite>Mrs. Doubtfire</cite> or Tom Hanks in 2004’s <cite>The Terminal</cite>. When you finish the film, you realize it is the type of performance that feels like a present. As you go home, they refuse to say goodbye. </p>

                    <p>It is only fitting that Robert De Niro is the actor who provides Ben with such vigor. Ben is retired and living alone. At 70-years-old, he knows who he is, so he understands the type of dilemma he is in, too. Ben wants to have a purpose again. With De Niro, the audience responds to his character’s predicament immediately. In five minutes, we are cheering for this guy to find his way.</p>

                    <p>In Brooklyn, Ben finds a job posting for senior interns at a women’s fashion start-up. He applies and gets an offer. When he arrives for his first day, he is dressed in a beautiful, fitted suit. As we and the millennials in the office learn, that is not a one-off. That’s Ben.</p>

                    <p>Ben Whitaker is a case study in how to be in the workplace. Instead of googling for first-day tips, just watch Ben. When a colleague slights him, he is diplomatic. If he sees something, he practices confidentiality. If he is not assigned work, he finds a way to be productive. Ben never complains nor does he lose his temper; he stays on an even-keel.</p>

                    <p>He allows his millennial colleagues to vent, alleviate their stress, and calmly reassures them – turning their point of view so they recognize their own agency. Ben keeps his opinion to himself unless he is asked to share it. Most importantly, Ben is always willing to learn and enthusiastic about a challenge – a rare and valuable trait. Everyone doubts him because of how he looks, but he is the perfect employee. Though, he would never say it.</p>

                    <p>Ben reports to Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway, another heavyweight actress of her generation. Jules is the millennial founder and CEO of About The Fit, which she has grown to two hundred employees. Setting a high standard for her company, she finds the broader world of venture capitalism and start-ups inaccessible, feeling that being a woman inhibits people’s expectations of what she and her company can do.</p>

                    <p>As an unlikely pair, Ben and Jules start to tackle two biases together. Time and time again, the millennials in the office are surprised at Ben’s impressive range of capabilities. He can get that data analyzed – and look like the sharpest guy in the office, too. Ben’s younger colleagues start to ask him for advice. Jules feels like no one sees her as a competent CEO, just as a woman that ought to be replaced soon. Yet, her employees respond to her leadership.</p>

                    <p>Nancy Meyers, the writer-director of <cite>The Intern</cite>, is an actors’ director. Her work feels effortless to view. Rather than achieving a unique shot, she is more concerned with bringing out and capturing the actors’ performances. The dialogue feels like natural speech, the editing is modern, the framing is often a medium two-shot and steady. Nothing will surprise you about the way this film looks – and that is not a bad thing! In Meyers’s eyes, she needs to keep the audience’s focus on the characters. She succeeds.</p>

                    <p>Twice a year, my family and I have returned to this classic buddy film. We know the story quite well. Yet, we come back to see relationships bloom between people of different generations. De Niro, Hathaway, and the ensemble cast pour so much life into these characters that <cite>The Intern</cite> does not lose its resonance. There is something that can be learned from anyone you meet. How could you get tired of seeing bridges get built between people? It is a much-needed tonic for our era.</p>
