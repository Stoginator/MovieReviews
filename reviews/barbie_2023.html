    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>When I saw 2017’s <cite>Lady Bird</cite>, I was immediately taken by an imitate tale of mother and daughter bound by a deep love for each other yet separated by misunderstandings. Divided by the typical type of conflicts that come between college-bound teenagers and their mothers. It was totally relatable, feeling more poignant as I get older. What struck me then was the distinct voice behind the camera: perceptively and sincerely following a flawed, determined young woman.</p>

                    <p>So, when <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/greta-gerwig-barbie-movie-director-margot-robbie-noah-baumbach-1235015427/">the news broke</a> that this great voice decided to tackle the most popular girls toy in America, I was intrigued. Flash forward a couple years and the summer of 2023 is <a href="https:/www.wsj.com/articles/the-summer-women-flexed-their-spending-power-dc2ce92c?st=c0oekovvf9e30y2&reflink=article_copyURL_share">the summer of women</a>. In time, this summer will bring back nostalgic memories of <a href="https://tstheerastour.taylorswift.com/">The Eras Tour</a> which has revived local economies, inspired pop-up sing-alongs outside stadiums, and caused a shortage of bracelet beads. And, of course, Barbie, the film that drove the "<a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2023/AMC-Theatres-Posts-Its-Best-Admissions-Revenue-Week-in-the-Companys-103-Year-History-July-21-27-and-the-Barbenheimer-Phenomenon-Continues-for-a-Second-Straight-Weekend/default.aspx">biggest week</a>" in AMC Theatres’ 103-year history.</p>

                    <p>The results are definitive: Greta Gerwig is the new go-to studio director in town, leading women directors towards new heights in a men’s field. In a big-budget, studio movie about a global property, the most exciting question is, “Where do Gerwig’s immense creative talents go?”</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Meet Stereotypical Barbie: a picturesque representation of the “perfect” American woman. Played by Margot Robbie, an actor and producer who brought Gerwig onto the project, there is a joyous idealism – and an obvious sarcasm from the filmmakers - behind her character and her world.</p>

                    <p>She lives in Barbieland, an amazingly vibrant realm featuring all the playhouses and locations found in toy sets, which is led by Barbies. A Barbie is President, another wins Pulitzer Prizes, two run the local ambulance, while a number of Barbies exclusively command the Supreme Court. It seems like a nice place, but there is an accident waiting to happen in plain sight.</p>

                    <p>Enter Ken. Honestly, I had no idea what a Ken was until <cite>Toy Story 3</cite> or even that there are many Kens. In <cite>Barbie</cite>, there is a Ryan Gosling Ken, a Simu Liu Ken, and about one-hundred-and-fifty-two more. No matter the Ken, his only purpose is to find meaning through Barbie. His identity does not exist otherwise.</p>

                    <p>The beginning of the film is quite airy, leisurely setting up character, world, and the ethos of the movie – all with a sense of fun. So much of the meaning of the film is simply left unsaid, but I kept wondering, “What is the story?” I will not spoil when it arrives, but there is an actual record scratch afterwards. In movies, there are moments that make you commit to a viewing. That was when I went all in.</p>

                    <p>Barbie and Ken join forces and journey to the real world. When they arrive, they discover something very different from Barbieland. Barbies believe they have lifted women up in the real world. When Stereotypical Barbie is disrespected in the real world, objectified by men and blamed by a teenager for perpetuating unrealistic expectations of women en masse, she crumbles.</p>

                    <p>When Ken walks around Century City in Los Angeles, he sees power associated with gender: men run big businesses, waive around fancy degrees, pump iron, idealize horses and cowboys, and can treat women poorly. Ken discovers some useful notion called the patriarchy. The entire segment is hilariously on-the-nose, poking at scenarios that are true more often than not. It was a highlight. Ken endeavors to change Barbieland forever.</p>

                    <p>A fight for the soul of Barbieland ensues. There is so much social commentary packed into this film on social acceptance, masculinity, and even special elections (like the one just run in Ohio). Apparently, no one likes Midge, the pregnant Barbie who is the running joke of the film. Perhaps, no theme is more potent than what Barbie means to womanhood. Is it an idea that denigrates the female experience, lifts it up, or both in different measures? While Barbies originally run Barbieland without any Kens, they learn to use their power to slowly shift Kens into leading positions. To paraphrase one Barbie, she says definitely not the Supreme Court yet, but how does a circuit court sound? That is a hysterical and sarcastic call-out, but one point of <cite>Barbie</cite> is that women’s empowerment is not winner-take-all. When men and women are equal, no one is worse off. <cite>Barbie</cite> has an inclusive take on feminism.</p>

                    <p>The most satisfying journey to see is Stereotypical Barbie’s arc. It is Gerwig’s showstopper and the element that ties back into her previous work. Just like Christine McPherson in <cite>Lady Bird</cite>, Stereotypical Barbie is a character that learns the truth about herself – and the audience gets to appreciate the beauty of how. It certainly will speak – and it certainly has – to women everywhere, but even I was feeling quite emotional.</p>

                    <p><cite>Barbie</cite> has all the trappings of studio fare: a sparkling cast, an epic fight, and bespoke (😉) music. My favorite is the electrifying Dua Lipa song, <cite>Dance The Night</cite>. (The omission of “away” is likely to avoid turning heads associated with Van Halen’s epic <cite>Dance The Night Away</cite>). The film crossed one billion dollars in box office gross and is on track to be Warner Brother’s highest grossing film ever; it is going to keep filling theaters with moviegoers into the fall!</p>

                    <p>Studios would do well to take the right notes on why <cite>Barbie</cite> became 2023’s great cinematic phenomenon. This is not Mattel’s movie; it is Gerwig’s expression through and through. <cite>Barbie</cite> is connecting with so many people because Gerwig has attached a well-known property to the best hallmarks of her style: honesty, sensitivity, and self-discovery. I am excited to see the next story in her canon.</p>
