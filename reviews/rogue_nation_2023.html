					<p>There’s no doubt about it: <i>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</i> is a thrilling movie. In 2023, one would expect nothing less from maestros Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie, and the production team behind this series. Nonetheless, this film was an important step in the evolution of the series. It is bigger, bolder, and more character-driven than the previous peak set by its predecessor, <i>Ghost Protocol</i>. Upon closer inspection, the structure of both films are quite similar. Ethan escapes, the IMF gets disbanded and its agents are disavowed, the Burj Khalifa is traded for an underwater vault (and a plane!), but the ending of this story feels authentic to this film. Regardless of the finer points, the set-pieces and the execution are different enough that the film is just as enjoyable.</p>

					<p>A most welcome addition to the cast of characters is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is inspired by the Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) of 1942’s <i>Casablanca</i>. Faust even brings the team to Casablanca! Ferguson’s character proves to be mysterious and totally captivating. Usually, side characters in a film with a special leading man are the least enjoyable part of the experience, but the character of Ilsa Faust has a certain gravity. To me, it has nothing to do with her predicament, and everything to do with her character being an equal to Ethan Hunt (and Tom Cruise). Rebecca Ferguson is very fun to watch in this role.</p>

					<p>In this film, the IMF is going after the Syndicate, an organization of former spies and government agents who have gone “rogue,” so to speak. While the film doesn’t delve too deep into the group’s braintrust, the Syndicate presents an interesting dynamic to be mined. If the “good guys” manipulate, abandon, and even attack their own, who is to say that another group using the same tactics is “bad?” If the bonds between Ethan’s team are so strong, imagine the bonds between those who trust has been betrayed. What lengths would they go to in order to exact revenge? <i>Rogue Nation</i> does not go so deep, but I think it poses interesting, underutilized questions. Of course, one question that is answered is: how can such a group be stopped?</p>

					<p>One slight qualm was the music. It felt very brass heavy, dependent on the classic Lalo Schifrin <i>Mission: Impossible</i> theme, and unfortunately one-note. It’s a telling sign that my favorite sequence was the intrusion of the Vienna opera. Watching a high-stakes fight set to the dramatic music of <i>Turandot</i> is brilliant and thrilling, but the film’s soundtrack did not stand out so well. It is not distracting, but it certainly is not memorable. </p>

					<p>In <i>Ford v. Ferrari</i>, Christian Bale’s character Ken Miles (a real-life racecar driver) tells his son about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLHmFnim1Ws">the idea of a perfect lap</a>: “No mistakes. Every gear change, every corner. Do you see it?” The team behind this series knows what is out there. This film feels like two artists approaching mastery of the action genre, but that isn’t enough. They are in pursuit of perfection.</p>
