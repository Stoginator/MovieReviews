    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Manchester By The Sea</cite> shows us the center of the story in the opening shots: an uncle, Lee (Casey Affleck), horsing around with his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), aboard the family’s fishing vessel. It is a glimpse of their being in a different time before they were suddenly gripped by the loss of a brother and a father. The film is about Lee and Patrick’s journey away from trying times.
                    </p>

                    <p>The cause of this film’s staying power in my psyche is Casey Affleck’s performance as Lee Chandler. Lee looks like a regular guy, except he’s not. The scars that he shoulders are immediately visible. He displays a frequent inability to make eye contact, feels no reason to end unbearably long silences, remains disinterested in hockey, and rejects attempts for others’ caring touch. As we learn, the character we meet has completely devolved from the man he once was. Social norms are not front of mind. The things he used to love do not bring him solace anymore.</p>

                    <p>Lee is possessed by a nagging sense of guilt for his past actions and a great deal of shame for his hidden notoriety in Manchester. His propensity for drunken bar fights comes from a dark place: a need for all that pain to go somewhere. Near the end of the film, he finally gets the beating he desperately craves. For the first time, he looks as bad on the outside as he does on the inside.</p>

                    <p>Great films distill a person’s life and make you feel like you’ve known them for years. From time to time, we enter Lee’s perspective seeing his flashbacks as they happen. The film editing by Jennifer Lame invigorates the telling by intercutting between different storylines and keeping us learning. More impressively, while the film deals with heavy situations, it never becomes overbearing – allowing us to recover and continue with the story.</p>

                    <p>But how? This story is so dense with emotion that director Kenneth Lonergan has to conspicuously tame it. Take the series of events that explain why Lee Chandler is known as “The Lee Chandler” around Manchester. Almost the entirety of <em>that</em> memory is set to a classical score. Imagine instead if this scene embraced the absence of music. It would have been so devastating to the audience that it may have gone too far. It is one of many examples of musical montage that train our senses to keep expecting more – until the creators buck their own style and we are left stunned by the film’s showstopper: an unexpected encounter between Lee and Randi (Michelle Williams).</p>

                    <p>What hasn’t been said about this scene? It features two actors at the peak of their abilities. Most of the dialogue is spoken in a stammer. A few sentences make their way out. Both characters contradict themselves. Their encounter feels like an eruption of emotion from two individuals who can only commiserate with each other. Importantly, there is no music. It is an editorial decision of "inordinate restraint." The filmmakers build up a tool for emotional impact throughout the movie and preserve its devastating blow for the climax of the film.</p>

                    <p>Early in the film, Lee arrives at Patrick’s hockey practice to deliver some terrible news. As the scene ends, Lee is eclipsed as the hockey team races past, while Patrick skates in the opposite direction of his team. It is a moment of visual poetry illustrating where these characters are. On that note, <cite>Manchester By The Sea</cite>’s open ending felt fitting. Personally, I take comfort in knowing the only time we see Lee smile post-incident is back on the refurbished boat named after his mother, <cite>Claudia Marie</cite>, with his nephew is busy impressing a girl behind the wheel. In a weird way, the uncle and nephew needed each other to move forward.</p>

                    <p>What this film gets right about trauma is it is almost always unspoken and left hanging around in the air. Importantly, none of the dialogue ever feels didactic or cringe-inducing (except when it is supposed to). The characters of <cite>Manchester By The Sea</cite> mostly wear their feelings on their sleeve without referencing them; conversations about “moving to Boston” are about something too painful to speak of. These characters know the real conflict is out of bounds. The melodrama that Lonergan avoids is agonizingly left to our imagination.</p>

                    <p>I could have easily spent two more hours with the Chandlers, but that is the mark of a master at work. Kenneth Lonergan has condensed the lives of these characters into a fleeting two hours – allowing us to take on their troubles and see how they confront them.</p>

                    <p><cite>Manchester By The Sea</cite> gets all the small details right. Look at the Northeast in the movie: the houses, the churches, and especially all that snow. But also look at Lee: his grief feels pervasive and is expressed in familiar and truthful ways. Even if my wish goes nowhere, it just feels right to say: I hope the Chandlers are doing well.</p>
