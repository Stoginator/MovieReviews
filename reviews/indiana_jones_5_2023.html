    			<h1><cite>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</cite></h1>
    			<p>July 8, 2023 - 6:00 PM - Dolby Cinema</p>
                <p><i>An unworthy adventure.</i></p>
                <q>Whatever I did, I apologize.</q>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Indiana Jones was given the perfect runway … twice! 1989’s <cite>The Last Crusade</cite> had him riding into the sunset with his father and his best friends. 2008’s <cite>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</cite> reunited him with his soulmate, Marion. For another sequel to take place, there better be a good reason. Otherwise, why reintroduce this character to millions when his story has already been completed?</p>

                    <p>I was expecting to discover a purpose for this movie, a self-evident reason why it should exist. The most prominent reason for Dial of Destiny is action, but car chases, close calls, and fights are never enough on their own. Action can be staged well, presented well, and occasionally thrill. But action without a purpose, a genuine motivation for the characters to be in it, feels hollow. Watch 2016’s <cite>Jason Bourne</cite> to see action that is mostly boring and sporadically fun.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, a purpose exists. Most disappointingly, it will not satisfy the soul of many fans. We meet a lonely Indiana Jones who has become a drinker. He is retiring and living a small apartment with seemingly no adventures left to go on. Of course, there is always one more. </p>

                    <p>Indiana Jones’s character arc is not the one we might associate with him. He is dissatisfied with his older body, penitent about decisions he did not take, and now left alone. He is coerced by his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) into a new adventure. The two certainly have a chemistry, but it never quite clicked to provide my full engagement in the story beats. I enjoyed the villain (Mads Mikkelson), but his goons were more annoying than a delightful challenge. Not much is funny either: my most memorable laugh came from the Wilhelm scream early in the movie. Some familiar faces return and new faces join, but no new characters reach the heights of Short Round, Marcus Brody, Marion, Sallah, or, my favorite, Dr. Jones Sr.</p>

                    <p>There are very brief, shining moments of brilliance. A bar fight in Tangiers resurrects the whip and features a new take on a classic moment that brought a smile to my face. Somehow, a plane flies into a fissure of time in a whirlwind of excitement. There was something to be found here, but it comes too late. At this point, it would have been more fun to see the mystical elements at play, rather than retreading what has been done already.</p>

                    <p>Some of the visual effects looked very out of place like the backgrounds of New York City, the parade chase, and especially young Indiana Jones. It feels very awkward to see an older Harrison Ford playing his younger self with an older voice. In motion, the facial work feels unconvincing and not invisible, as it should be. Matching the visual textures of the original trilogy is likely an impossible ask, but the organic, filmic sense was lost in too many scenes due to digital interference.</p>

                    <p>One of the compelling reasons to see this movie was to hear what is likely to be John Williams last movie score. At age 91, he is our greatest living film composer, a true legend. In a Dolby Cinema, I was expecting to hear his last score in a pristine environment. Unfortunately, the mix was weighted so heavily towards sound effects that his score was inaudible for most of the action scenes. My theater also played the movie <i>loud</i>! I will be listening separately to the score, but it was nice to hear <cite>Raiders March</cite> one last time during the end credits.</p>

                    <p>Near the end of the film, a character says “You have to be here!” to Indiana. His reply: “For who?” It is the one of the few emotionally charged moments of the film. Indiana Jones is not the hero of this film; instead, he is saved by someone else. On paper, I can find myself thinking that it clicks. In execution, I found myself asking a similar question throughout the film: why does this chapter of Indiana’s story exist? Like Dr. Henry Jones, Sr. in his search for the Holy Grail, I temporarily became obsessed looking for an answer to satisfy my yearning for a new Indiana Jones adventure, when the hard truth is that a good enough answer does not exist.</p>

                    <p>I cannot help but see parallels between Indiana Jones and Han, Leia, and Luke. All characters brought back to the screen after long gaps only to be shown in old age and disrepair. Seeing how their stories ended (so far), these characters were best left alone. I sure hope this will be a lesson in theatrical over-fishing; the money spent is unlikely to be recouped.</p>

                    <p>As a fan, maybe I expected too much from what should be a comical, breakneck-paced movie. But each film has a point beyond the adventure. <cite>Raiders</cite> has the romance. <cite>Temple of Doom</cite> has another romance set in the past and a heroic mission to save a village. <cite>The Last Crusade</cite> has Indiana reconnecting with his father. Indiana Jones films have a heart behind the thrills. <cite>Dial of Destiny</cite> has a washed-up Indiana carried on an adventure while he battles the regret of past mistakes. There certainly is a heart, but not the story that is worthy of a telling.</p>
