    				<p>The 19th addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was the one that I have anticipated the most. Watching every interview of the cast I could find, I’ve been looking forward to this movie for a long time. My expectations were high. It would have been crushing if <cite>Infinity War</cite> sucked, but the best part is that it was one of the best Marvel movies yet.</p>

                    <p><cite>Infinity War</cite> basically combines every major character that has been introduced in the MCU. It features Thanos, the big-bad, the notorious villain that can do some real damage to the heroes I love. On these fronts, <cite>Infinity War</cite> is well-crafted. All of the characters find utility in the movie to advance the plot and/or be funny (sadly, I felt Steve Rogers was underused). As for the villain, as soon as Thanos was introduced, he felt like a real threat to the Avengers. Thanos begins the movie with a single Stone and you quickly find out that he will go through anyone who tries to stop him from acquiring them all. For the first time in the MCU, the villain makes the heroes feel vulnerable and that makes you realize the creative team behind “Infinity War” is pulling no punches. Whether it’s Cap, Thor, or even Iron Man, no one is safe. Couple this with the fact that the movie does not stop - it never takes a break from telling its story - and Thanos becomes the most effective villain in the MCU.</p>

                    <p>As told by previous MCU movies, the characters are split up. <cite>Infinity War</cite> follows one group of characters at a time by intercutting their plot-lines. This actually works seamlessly because each group has such a significant role in the story and also because of the audience’s investment in the 18 movies which came before. Spread across the universe, the only constant between them is Thanos and his relentless quest for the six Infinity Stones. </p>

                    <p><cite>Infinity War</cite> is the culmination of ten years of the MCU, and it certainly feels climatic.</p>
