    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 film, <cite>Spartacus</cite>, debuted at the beginning of a tumultuous period in American history. A month after the film’s release, John F. Kennedy won in one of the closest American presidential elections ever. The Civil Rights Movement was operating full steam ahead, with a renewed promise of federal legislation protecting African Americans. The hard work of ending discrimination and disenfranchisement – and, in doing so, pursuing the cause of freedom – was thick in the air. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes, the psyche of an era can deeply influence the making of a motion picture. Spartacus fits this mold, where the history of the moment has bled into the story we see. Even more so than today, mainstream American audiences were sensitive to depictions of slavery at the movie theater. For the most part, the subject matter was relegated to the historical and religious epics of the era like 1956’s <cite>The Ten Commandments</cite> and 1959’s <cite>Ben-Hur</cite>, both far away from slavery’s presence in American history.</p>

                    <p>Enter Spartacus, a rebellious slave working himself to death somewhere in the vast Roman Empire. The brutality of the operation around him is self-evident: men who toil all day in the hot sun, beaten when they stop to catch their breath, and subject to cruel punishments if disobedient. Starving to death for attacking a Roman officer, Spartacus is selected as a gladiator by Lentulus Batiatus, an ingratiating slave owner, exhaling debauchery in his quiet corner of the world, that is compellingly portrayed by Peter Ustinov.</p>

                    <p>The characters representing the ruling classes of Rome are so unsympathetic, why are they undeniably compelling? For one, there is immense acting caliber portraying them. I wondered further: if I were this person of nobility in their circumstance at that time, would I be any different?</p>

                    <p>In the countryside, we see how corrupted the moral compass of the ruling class of Romans is. They watch as men murder each other for their pleasure, valuing other humans less preciously than those in their own class. It is a stark reality that, for most of human history, civilizations were organized in a way that unequally valued life. In many places in the world, it is still this way. <cite>Spartacus</cite> shoots us directly into this realm, burning with incredulity and appreciative of the titular character’s nobility. In his pursuit of justice, Spartacus rejects a mob-like worship of himself, and persistently takes the high road. Historical dramas reaching into the past always need a reason for relevance today: what similarities can we learn that help us navigate the treacherous current? </p>

                    <p>In 1960, the legend of Spartacus was the anachronism, a man of unnoble origins whose profile rises above the gilded temples of the Roman Senate. Spartacus was the warrior belonging to another age. In 2024, what becomes more apparent is the usurping of power by Crassus (Laurence Olivier) to bring peace and stability to Rome. In a time of need, a clearly self-interested man converts a “democracy” into a dictatorship. While Crassus’s leadership successfully quenches the rebellion, the fall of Rome only foreshadows events yet to come.</p>

                    <p>Epic in scale, with hundreds of performers entering the field of battle atop vast landscapes, sometimes I think, <q>They don’t make ‘em like they used to.</q> Such scope in filmmaking was more common because it was a necessity: the only way to film a battle scene was to stage a thousand actors in full costume. We see glimpses of practical large-scale filmmaking today, most notably in 2020’s <cite>Tenet</cite>, but too often, the safety and allure of computer-generated imagery sucks out the oxygen of assembling such masses.</p>

                    <p>Listening to Alex North’s magnificent score throughout the film, one cannot help but hear its inspiration in the themes that came from John Williams. It is hard to place, but it can be heard in the opening moments of <cite>Goodbye, My Life, My Love</cite>: the strings representing Varinia (Jean Simmons) and Spartacus’s love for each other followed by the solumn horns accompanying Spartacus’s crucifixion. Who will win: the strings or the horns?</p>

                    <p>The tragic ending of <cite>Spartacus</cite> offers both sorrow and hope, in a note of irony. Spartacus has given the ultimate sacrifice to his cause, suffering a slow death upon the cross. In a stroke of luck, he views his wife and son – for both the first and last time. As Spartacus dies a slave to Rome, his son, however, is a free boy – and his mother will make sure he remembers the legend of his father. Spartacus’s journey shows us the price for freedom.</p>
