    				<p><cite>Rudy</cite> has restored my faith in movies. After being fed visual effects-laden movies for almost a year, I can say, it isn't the healthiest diet, but maybe the worst. <cite>Rudy</cite> seems to be a product of its time. A movie with long, focused character shots, a music score heightening plot points and highlighting emotional moments, and showcasing a genuine, underdog story.</p>

                    <p><cite>Rudy</cite> begins in a small steel town where everyone knows their neighbors. The main character, of course, is Daniel E. "Rudy" Ruettiger, who fantasizes, dreams, and aspires to play for the Fighting Irish football team of the University of Notre Dame. Rudy grows up in a football house and he plays football with his brothers and friends. His town lives and breathes football, but sadly accepts that no one of them can play it for real. Then, Rudy comes along - growing up in this community - and he wants to play football at his favorite college.</p>

                    <p>Rudy doesn't just make sacrifices to live his dream, his decision is being constantly challenged at his every turn. His teacher says he isn't gifted enough, his brother mocks him, his family loses faith, his soon-to-be-wife leaves him, and his grades do not reflect his passion. Rudy even loses his best friend - the only one that took him seriously - in a steel mill accident. For any person, any one event from this set would be enough to knock them down hard, but the fact that Rudy not only got back up, but fought harder is a testament to human willpower. He had to fight for years upon years. After being pushed and pushed, Rudy broke through the barriers to accomplish his dreams and fulfill his life's pursuit. If any man is a modern-day inspiration, Rudy is one of them.</p>

                    <p>Before the cinema industry shifted towards effects-driven films, there were character-driven films centered on their stories. I did not only sympathize with Rudy, I wanted to see him succeed because he had earned it from the beginning. That is what is missing from movies nowadays. <cite>Rudy</cite> sent a message that dreams can be achieved, but not easily. You have to be willing enough to see yourself succeed, and do not take that lightly.</p>

                    <p>I shall never forget that this was a true story. When Rudy faced an obstacle in the film, it happened. When Rudy is carried off the field for the first time in Notre Dame history, it happened.</p>
