    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>These days, I find myself going to the theater without too much knowledge of the film I am going to see. <cite>Black Bag</cite> is a prime example; it is an original film that has flown under the radar. When I discovered the talent involved, I felt that the film demanded a viewing. It stars two of the best living actors, Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett, as a married couple in British intelligence who live and breathe the art of spy-craft. The script is written by David Koepp, whose illustrious penmanship includes 1993’s <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>, 1996’s <cite>Mission: Impossible</cite>, and 2002’s <cite>Spider-Man</cite>. Behind the camera, cutting the film, and managing the vision is Steven Soderbergh, who is tackling the spy genre for the first time forty years into his directorial career.</p>

                    <p>Are you excited yet?</p>

                    <p><cite>Black Bag</cite> opens with a long tracking shot, which is held on the back of Michael Fassbender as his character walks into a nightclub. The feeling it produces is the opposite of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrpmF1GzC0&t=22s">Martin Scorsese’s famous one-shot</a> of Ray Liotta entering the Copacabana club in 1990’s <cite>Goodfellas</cite>. Scorsese’s shot was about witnessing glamour, making us feel like a guy who hit it big time. Not this one.</p>

                    <p>Instead, we sense Fassbender is searching. Without a word of dialogue, we instinctually ask ourselves the central question of the film: <q>Who's he looking for?</q> The framing against Fassbender’s back is held, as he analyzes his surroundings and we scan the picture. There is a palpable sense of tension and of unanswered questions. Remarkably, this tracking shot introduces the main character, sets the mood of the film, and explains its central conceit. What a way to begin a movie!</p>

                    <p>The tracking shots don’t stop there. The triple-threat editor, cinematographer, and director Soderbergh tracks Fassbender and Blanchett walking in offices and cities - all set to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0t3llUNCND5TVe6BdC0MKs">compelling spy music</a> by his longtime composer David Holmes. For the audience, <cite>Black Bag</cite> is a mental chess game, so all the walking gives us fleeting moments to think: <q>Who’s the rat?</q></p>

                    <p>That is the mission of George Woodhouse, played by Fassbender. Woodhouse has a name fit for an English statesman as well as the field skills of a seasoned veteran. There are five suspects, all employed in British Intelligence. We are given a single, absolute fact: One of them stole something called <em>Severus</em>, which is likely an allusion to Professor Severus Snape, the literary character in <cite>Harry Potter</cite>, who was a double-agent the whole time. As Woodhouse begins his search, the game is on.</p>

                    <p>The game we join is a psychological one, where we question many characters’ motivations, but wonder if we are correct to do so. Uncertain loyalties empower a top-notch cast, led by Fassbender and Blanchett, with supporting characters who rise to the occasion. The troupe executes a web of mysteries that consistently forces us to second-guess our ideas.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>Black Bag</cite>, we adopt the persona of these intelligence agents. They are fiends for the drip-drip of information. Their mentality is passed on to the audience so that we feel any detail could crack the who-done-it. Even with piles of surveilance technology at Woodhouse’s disposal, none of it can read minds. Unfortunately for Woodhouse, it appears the plan for <em>Severus</em> is locked away in the safest possible vault. Until we know it, we are subject to it. This is the suspense that kept me alert and forced me to scan the frame.</p>

                    <p>David Koepp has crafted a magnificent script, made in the tradition of rewatch-ability. Edited to a brisk ninety-two minutes, the average number of words per minute skyrockets during dialogue-driven scenes. Koepp knows the audience cannot catch all the details on a first viewing, so the film is structured to be returnable.</p>

                    <p>While theatrical departures from the reality of spy-craft is expected in any fictitious film, <cite>Black Bag</cite> manages to build an aura of authenticity around its plot. Koepp has thoroughly researched the story, by interviewing members of the intelligence community. It shows! There are references to real matters of cyber espionage, recognizable to anyone in the field, which lends credibility to the film’s fictitious nature.</p>

                    <p><cite>Black Bag</cite> is a fully participatory experience at the movies. Throughout the film, the audience asks a steady cadence of questions, which subsides only at the end. Remarkably, the film’s answers are always discovered at just the right time, before we eject ourselves from the experience. This is a risky maneuver! Waiting too long to reveal information, not properly answering a question, or building up too many questions at once can undo the spell. It is a testament to Koepp and Soderbergh’s skill that the dominos topple exactly when they desire.</p>

                    <p>The audience plays second fiddle to George Woodhouse, piecing the narrative together like his detective side-kick. Though, what makes it so satisfying is that <cite>Black Bag</cite> is not a straightforward journey. It zigs and zags; or put more formally, there are red-herrings, surprises, and  a few moments of utter clarity. It is a symphony of great elements, with no fluff, coming together in just the right way. As the curtains closed, I wanted to rewind this movie right back to the beginning.</p>
