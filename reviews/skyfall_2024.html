    				<p>I have always been fascinated by Daniel Craig’s version of James Bond. When the character walks, his shoulders creep up, his elbows bend back, his hands float at his side, and his head bobs a bit. Only one hand ever enters his pocket if he can manage it. This Bond never offers a full-toothed smile, just a scrunched grin. Especially on the job, his eyes carefully survey his surroundings, letting know that he is planning his next moves and predicting those of his opponent. He maintains a sharp wit, he holds strong opinions, and he never ever says more than he needs to say.</p>

                    <p>Much of the good fortune of 2012’s <cite>Skyfall</cite>, which released on the 50th anniversary of the first James Bond film, 1962’s Dr. No, comes from its clever script by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan. For an action franchise built on the coolness of the English spy world, the best scenes in <cite>Skyfall</cite> are ping-pong conversations where two characters attempt to one-up each other through verbal gamesmanship.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Bond: <q>You should have trusted me to finish the job.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">M: <q>It was a possibility of losing you or the certainty of losing all those other agents. I made the only decision I could and you know it.</q></blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">M: <q>What are you expecting? A bloody apology? You know the rules of the game. You’ve been playing it long enough. We both have.</q></blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">M: <q>Speak for yourself.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>These scenes pack intellectual and dramatic heft, but they also fill out the movie; almost every introductory conversation between two characters is a verbal battle. It is a deliberate, hidden-in-plain-sight achievement that gives <cite>Skyfall</cite> a nice edge. In fact, there are five great examples of this: Bond and Eve’s (Naomi Harris) banter in the Jeep in Istanbul, M (Judi Dench) and Mallory’s (Ralph Fiennes) dispute about her “voluntary” retirement, Bond and M’s clash in her London townhome about taking the shot, Bond and Q’s (Ben Whishaw) debate about the value of youth in an art museum, Bond and Severine’s (Bérénice Marlohe) discussion over a drink in Macau, and Bond and Silva’s (Javier Bardem) first encounter as foes on his desert island. All these characters in <cite>Skyfall</cite> begin their relationships with each other on tippy-toes.</p>

                    <p><cite>Skyfall</cite> is a spy story built around a sibling rivalry, where no one is related by blood, only choice of profession. The work environment at MI-6 strangely resembles a stoic family where everyone would die for each other, but never offer a hug. For the action genre and a James Bond film specifically, the stakes for <cite>Skyfall</cite>’s characters feel unusually personal. The conflict is this: one sibling seeks to protect their Mother and the other seeks to destroy her. Both desire her affection, but they use extremely different tactics to earn it.</p>

                    <p>In Silva, there is the twisted brother-by-profession that Bond never knew he had. When Bond meets him, he underestimates his tenacity and grows impatient with his schemes.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>When Bond finally hears his story, he is probably thinking, “You look better behind a sealed door.” When he escapes the confinement, Bond learns his lesson.</p>

                    <p>M is the mother-figure that every agent wishes to please. Bond does not resent her for making a near-fatal choice that could have finished the job. Silva does. So how do you please a mother who sacrificed your life and exiled you away to the Chinese government? Take her with you to the grave.</p>

                    <p>When you bring director Sam Mendes’s team into this script, you get a mixture with high potential. The cinematography by Roger Deakins has staying power and follows the philosophy of a drama, not an action film. There is no shaky cam, just simple pans, tilts, and cranes. What resulted is indelible: the dark one-shot of Bond’s fight with Patrice on the edge of a Shanghai skyscraper; Bond running opposite the flow of traffic in London; Bond and M taking in the view of Scotland next to an Aston Martin DB-5; a solemn Bond standing on top of MI-5.</p>

                    <p>Countering the knee-jerk style of action films after The <cite>Bourne</cite> Trilogy, editors Stuart and Kate Baird follow suit by holding the shots much longer than average - in a welcome return to tradition. Everything else about the film, the ping-pong dialogue, the extended action sequences, and the quick changes of scenery make these choices work wonderfully. It alters a film packed to the brim with change with an old-fashioned steadiness, retrofitted to today’s era of filmmaking. The construction of <cite>Skyfall</cite> is very much a case of “old dog, new tricks.”</p>
                    
                    <p>The sound mix is no exception. I was blown away by a simple, effective, and rather subconscious use of environmental sound. When Bond is hit by Eve’s bullet and knocked off the train, she reports back to M: “Agent down.” As M turns her back to the agency employees in her office, the rain softly pattering on the window becomes a heavy gush of water as Bond washes away on the current. We feel a wave of emotion hit M.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>After the opening credits featuring Adele’s perfect theme song, the sound of soft rain returns as M writes 007’s obituary in darkness. The next day, she sits in a company car, staring out another window as church bells fill the air. The subliminal messaging leads us into M’s state of mind in the same way subtext lays a foundation for interesting dialogue. She is grieving Bond’s death. I have seen this film many, many times. I just realized why I felt the way I did. There is a reason I always kept returning.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another prime excuse to re-enter the world of <cite>Skyfall</cite> is Thomas Newman’s score, which continued his relationship with Sam Mendes after starting with 2000’s <cite>American Beauty</cite> and 2002’s <cite>Road to Perdition</cite>. Neither person had made an action film. They came to this project completely fresh – and with that spark of creativity, Newman made a soundtrack for the ages. Considering more than half of the film contains music, it is astonishingly original. The film runs 143 minutes, while the score runs over 77 minutes. Going track-to-track, you will not find anything stale - which is rare in the days of editors using “temp music,” the soundtracks of other films to provide a rhythm to cut a movie.</p>

                    <p>Other than mandatory use of the classic Bond theme by John Barry, Newman made sequence and location-specific themes meant for a single-use. It is an extraordinary commitment, seldom seen on a film of this scale. Due to the magnitude of his achievement, it is worth dissecting the best tracks.</p>
                    
                    <p><cite>Grand Bazaar, Istanbul</cite> and <cite>The Bloody Shot</cite> chronicle the opening chase, with its multiple changes of vehicle because of a few dead-ends. <cite>New Digs</cite> has my vote as of the coolest, most “spy-sounding” tracks ever; it was, and remains, difficult not to play repeatedly. <cite>Day Wasted</cite> begins with the mystery about Bond we do not know, his past as a child, and ends with a glimmer of the Bond we do know: the spy, 007.</p>

                    <p><cite>Brave New World</cite> caps perhaps the best introductory conversation in the film between Bond and Q in the art museum - and then introduces us to Shanghai in epic style.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Q: <q>Well, I'll hazard I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.</q></blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Q: <q>Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Bond: <q>Or not pulled. It's hard to know which in your pajamas. Q.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Q: <q>007.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Bond: <q>Maybe too long.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">M: <q>Speak for yourself.</q></blockquote>

                    <p><cite>Komodo Dragon</cite> is about the re-entrance of Bond, clean-shaven, in a tuxedo, on a dangerous mission, and definitely back from the dead. <cite>Severine</cite> is the most beautiful sounding track in Skyfall, one of purest pieces of music that Newman has ever made. If you played it for someone, they would ask if it was Mozart. Somehow it is not; it’s from a James Bond movie.</p>

                    <p>The second half of the film is filled with action set pieces. Given that, Newman’s music brings an epic-ness that make the sequences feel unique and complete: <cite>The Chimera</cite>, <cite>Quartermaster</cite>, <cite>Tennyson</cite>, <cite>Breadcrumbs</cite>, <cite>Kill Them First</cite>, and <cite>Deep Water</cite>. The music is so memorable that you may remember what was happening on-screen after just one watch.</p>

                    <p>There is one notable exception to the single-use rule: <cite>Voluntary Retirement</cite> plays as M grieves the loss of MI-5 employees lost in a terrorist attack. As M departs at the end of the film, <cite>Mother</cite> reuses the same theme to express Bond’s grief for her.</p>

                    <p>The music’s terrific presence throughout the movie and overwhelming originality make it one of the best action film scores ever.</p>

                    <p>Given all the praise I have showered on <cite>Skyfall</cite>, surprisingly, I do have a few nitpicks. When Severine and Bond arrive on Silva’s desert island, why does the production design look so like the limbo world of 2010’s <cite>Inception</cite>?</p>

                    <p>There are also times during the film where the plot seems comically ridiculous. For example, why would Q, the smartest hacker in the world, plug in the enemy’s laptop and directly connect it to MI-6’s network? It turns out that Silva wanted to be captured by Bond and get locked up at MI-6 headquarters. That idea seems borrowed straight from the Joker’s machinations in 2008’s <cite>The Dark Knight</cite>. Certainly, Heath Ledger’s version of the Joker was an inspiration for the absolute chaos of Silva.</p>

                    <p>Keeping everything in mind, it is obvious that, with Skyfall, the soaring heights of the film far, far outreach any illogical or derivative patterns that can be found. It has been a joy to experience for over ten years. After all, the filmmakers found a lucky charm in the unlikeliest of places: the news anchor, Wolf Blitzer. With his impersonal, yet authoritative voice, Blitzer has been a key part of two of the best action movies of the 21st century: <cite>Skyfall</cite> and 2016’s <cite>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</cite>. If you want to make a legendary action film, he’s the man to hire!</p>
