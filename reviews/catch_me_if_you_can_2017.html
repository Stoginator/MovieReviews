                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>Watching the opening scene of <cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> is reinvigorating. We learn that Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), impersonated a pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor, stole over four million dollars, and evaded a manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the United States – all before the age of 19. Even after countless viewings, the opening minutes effectively lure me in: the wonderful jazz from the master, John Williams, the disbelief as we learn the scale of one man’s mass deception, and the introduction of the film’s two buddies: Abagnale and the F.B.I. agent committed to closing his case, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). From the starting bell, Jeff Nathanson’s script is a page-turner – which I’ll bet is a big reason Hollywood itself assembled for this project.</p>
                    <p>This time, I was fascinated by the father-son duo of Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) and Frank Jr. (DiCaprio). We observe Frank Sr. as he tries to bend the reality of those he seeks to persuade: a clothing shop owner and a banking associate. The manipulative stories come so easy and seem somewhat harmless; in the pursuit of a goal, is it unethical? Ultimately, Frank Sr. fails to twist and turn the details about what is important and the law catches up to him. After he is found guilty of tax evasion, the Abagnale family lose their home, their prized belongings, and, eventually, their status as a family. For Frank Jr., the separation of his parents is unthinkable. The failures of the father – his inability to bend the reality of those with control – haunt his son, Frank Jr., who runs away from home.</p>
                    <p>What follows feels like a Greek tragedy. The son, in an unconscious attempt to avenge his father and restore what was lost, begins to use the same tools and tricks – and becomes more confident in the world. His gaming of the system starts with petty, bounced checks and escalates from stolen uniforms and fake degrees to the accumulation of millions of dollars. Will the son suffer the same fall as the father?</p>
                    <p>Powered by this core relationship, there are two conversations that dynamize the emotional arc of the film. In a gorgeously lit, New York restaurant, the father and son meet for the first time since Frank Jr. ran away. Frank Sr. knows a fake when he sees one. However, he respects that Frank Jr. is able to cross boundaries that he never did: fooling banks, leading the government on a merry-go-round, and earning money off of a dubious professional background. As a kid, Frank Jr. is just doing what he knows – exactly what his father taught him. For Frank Jr., if it restores his life back with the house, the car, and the complete family, it is worth it. Yet, we wonder: how can a well-meaning father not ask his son to be honest?</p>
                    <p>Some months later, the two meet again in a dimly lit bar. Frank Sr. seems possessed by his loss to the government: <q>They ate the cake. Now they want the crumbs.</q> Trying to find his words, he continues, <q>You know what? I’ll make them chase me for the rest of their lives.</q> On this note, Frank Sr. hugs his son.</p>

                    <p>In a close and lengthy embrace, each man holds on – for different reasons. Frank Jr. still believes in the myth of restoring his family. Frank Sr. will always believe in the myth that his son is defying the great powers. As the film deals with their relentless mythmaking, it says “Like father, like son.” However, when these myths are tested by the reality of the situation, the way these two characters handle the fracture separates them completely.</p>

                <section class="review-text">    
                    <p>Frank Sr. tells his Frank Jr. that his mother has remarried and now lives with another man. As that familial restoration myth breaks, Frank Jr. feels no reason to continue living the lie and he pleads with his father: <q>Then ask me to stop!</q> Unlike his father, Frank Jr. seems more aware of the lines he is crossing and the consequences for crossing them. In the ultimate expression of Frank Sr.’s character, he succinctly responds, <q>You can’t stop.</q> Without any reassurance from his father, Frank Jr. leaves the bar without another word.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the end of both scenes, Frank Sr. repeatedly asks, <q>Where are you going, Frank? Where you going?</q> Even though he may be setting his son on a path leading to Frank Jr.’s downfall, Frank Sr. is incapable of asking him to stop. He is living vicariously through the myth that his son is a glorious success, sticking it to the men who got him. For Frank Sr., the inescapable reality is much more disturbing than this lie.</p>

                    <p>The father-son relationship in <cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> is poignant and truthful. Regardless of the factual nature of these conversations, real life has been refined into an artistic treasure in the safe hands of filmmaking masters. The most “normal” character in the film, Carl Hanratty, has his own myth that he lives out. It is not a pernicious one, but one that makes getting by easier. All of these events raise a fundamental question for the audience. It is not loud; instead, it is whispered to the audience: <q>What myths do we live that make it easier to get by?</q> Maybe we are not so different from the Abagnale men.</p>

                    <p><u>Note</u>: I am surprised that <cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> is not on more Christmas watchlists. With all of its memorable encounters and lines, I have no choice but to declare it a Christmas staple. Listening to Judy Garland's <cite>Embraceable You</cite> and Nat King Cole's perfect rendition of <cite>The Christmas Song</cite>, you can practically hear it: <q>Carl! Merry Christmas! How is it we are always talking on Christmas, Carl! Every Christmas, I’m talking to you!</q></p>

                <section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> is a film "inspired by true events" about Frank Abagnale, Junior, a young imposter who impersonates a doctor, a lawyer, and an airline pilot. Pretty extraordinary, right? (Except for the fact that it's downright illegal and extremely dangerous.) Many of the situations in the film are embellished and glamorized, but what can one expect! This film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and is directed by Steven Spielberg. Let's raise our expectations even higher.</p>

                    <p>The film starts off by introducing us to FBI Agent Carl Hanratty searching for Frank Abagnale, Jr. in a French prison. Hanratty talks to Abagnale as if he's been duped before. Sure enough, Abagnale tricks Hanratty and almost escapes by pretending to pass out. Our initial suspicions about Abagnale through Hanratty's dialogue are confirmed. But, Abagnale, this barely twenty- year old trickster, is caught by U.S. authorities. Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson expertly intrigues us in asking: "What happened up to this point?", "Why did it happen?", and "How did it happen?" which continue to guide most of the film. </p>

                    <p>Next, <cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> explores Abagnale and Hanratty before they are introduced to each other. Abagnale is a clever, high school kid who has a nag for acting older than he actually is because of his confidence. His world is demolished when his parents become divorced and he is forced to decide who he'd rather be with. Abagnale runs away and begins securing money through forged checks. Hanratty is an FBI agent in the bureau's financial fraud unit focusing on tracing down the creators of forged checks. Their paths begin to cross.</p>

                    <p>Much of the film's most entertaining material comes from Hanratty's chase for Abagnale. Their encounters and discussions delve into their characters more thoroughly (maybe even more clearly and intensely) than their actions in the film. No one else breaks Abagnale's confident persona like Hanratty and the film thrives on the fact that these two characters are equals whose goals conflict each other. Hanratty has an advantage of age and stability which yields true confidence in the face of obstacles, yet Abagnale's weakness from his youth, inexperience, and ultimately familial insecurity is usually balanced by his cleverness. The gravity between the two characters comes from the idea that they are the only ones who understand each other. It is a weird and interesting predicament - that two people on opposing sides of the law find themselves most at home in each other's company. This drives the film forward and serves as an amazing answer to the audience's questions from the very first scene.</p>

                    <p>Much can be said about DiCaprio's performance as Abagnale. He is vulnerable when need be and a confident, older womanizer when he needs to cash a check. His character is so interesting because Abagnale is a paradox. Abagnale is both a kid and a con-man, a doctor and a lawyer, a convincing adult and a scared kid. The most heartbreaking scene is when Frank sees, with his own eyes, that the family he ran away from is no more. On the other hand, Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty is a presentation of a static character, one that goes through no major changes. Yet, Hanks, as the master performer, never undercuts his focus; Hanratty is determined to find an end to the case in every scene in which he appears.</p>

                    <p>Spielberg brings his special touch to the table - whether it be callbacks to <cite>E.T.</cite> with the low camera when Hanratty searches Abagnale's mansion or simply maintaining the thrill of the chase throughout the film. Composer John Williams brings his usually excellent touch to the proceedings with a gorgeous score brimming with jazz riffs and some lovely musical cues. The score is emotionally moving when needed and great at upping the tempo. The film also features Nat King Cole's masterpiece: <cite>The Christmas Song</cite>. I never knew the song before this film, but now I listen to it every Christmas - and every time I finish this film. <cite>Catch Me If You Can</cite> presents a story worth telling and one that was, without a doubt, told extremely well.</p>
