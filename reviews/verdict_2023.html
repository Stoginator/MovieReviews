				<section class="review-text">
    				<p><i>The Verdict</i> feels like a sports movie. How could I compare a courtroom drama to a movie where the characters play football? On first impression, <i>The Verdict</i> bears no resemblance to a typical Hollywood movie about sports, but the similarities practically write themselves: a broken, main character, who was once brimming with potential, needs a comeback.  Everyone who knows anything about him underestimates him. In fact, he is 0-4 in his last 4 court cases! Yet, he has the courage to take on the odds and the powers that be. He suffers betrayal, a rigged system, and just when all hope feels lost, a big, 4th quarter speech motivates justice to win out. Structurally speaking, <i>The Verdict</i> plays like <i>Rocky</i> (1976), <i>Invincible</i> (2006), or <i>Remember The Titans</i> (2000), but with sharper dialogue, a tighter story, and Paul Newman as the lead. Though this time, the game being played is nothing less than balancing the scale of the American justice system. A weighty story, indeed.</p>

    				<p>Innocently enough, the film opens on Paul Newman’s character, Frank Galvin, enchanted by pinball. But, his law practice is in disrepair. As a couple characters bluntly put it, Galvin is an “ambulance-chaser” and a constantly-inebriated lawyer. We are led to judge Galvin harshly early in the film by asking, “Why would anyone count on this guy?” Soon, we learn his story: caught on the wrong side of powerful people, abandoned, and now merely a shell of his former self. Once on a fast-track to a meaningful career, his reputation was ruined and now jobs don’t come easy. Galvin is a working class guy; luckily, his long-time mentor (Jack Warden) has one last job for him, one that can be his ticket into retirement. The set-up is the type of slower character building that is nascent in modern films; much of the strength of Galvin’s characterization is that he must be deciphered from his situation. Eventually, it’s hard not to sympathize with a guy like Galvin; his allure of pinball makes him feel that he is still good at something. </p>

    				<p>Galvin’s mentor sets him up on a slam-dunk medical malpractice case. Any lawyer could get a substantial settlement fee from the hospital and be off on to retirement ($70,000 in 1982 is roughly $220,000 today). Galvin’s client was given anesthesia when it was dangerous to do so and, as a result, she is bed-ridden and will be in a coma for the remainder of her life. Holding the settlement check in his hand, Galvin feels a great sense of personal injustice if he were to accept it. What number is a life worth? In front of powerful people, Galvin rejects the offer and courageously decides to take this case to court - making the same choice that led his life downhill once before. The odds are tipped against him now. The screenplay is fantastic at offering a conventional, underdog story and supplanting the audience’s expectations time and time again. Nothing is better designed and presented than Galvin’s history: his actions in the present contrasted with what happened in the past. They flipped my conceptions of Galvin from a washed-up drunk to an idealist who lost his way. I love this character.</p>

    				<p>The characters I didn’t love were purposely designed that way. The prejudiced folks in the mahogany conference rooms led by Ed Concannon (James Mason) who believe money can buy everything, a judge (Milo O’Shea) whose power flows into his little head, and Galvin’s love interest, Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling), someone who is uncovered to be a reflection of his inner demons.</p>

    				<p>In a lot of ways, <i>The Verdict</i> can be seen as a spiritual sequel to <i>12 Angry Men</i> (1957). Sidney Lumet directed both films as vehicles of courage. How one ordinary man (a lawyer and a juror, respectively) can coax a system into doing the right thing - which is an extraordinary event each time it happens. Both films follow seemingly open-and-shut cases that grow more complicated. Most notably, there is an idealism about how justice will prevail even in the face of prejudice and misuse of power. Both leave you trusting in the good intentions of our institutions and the remarkable people who preserve them.</p>

    				<p><i>The Verdict</i> probably will not induce the same elation that comes after watching <i>The Natural</i> (1984), <i>Creed</i> (2016), or even <i>A Few Good Men</i> (1992). But, there is a deeper sense of satisfaction when you follow the money. Like all systems of human design, the American justice system has its flaws and <i>The Verdict</i> showcases quite a few.  But <i>The Verdict</i> also leaves the audience to ruminate on the justice system at its best: when it promotes fairness or, in the American way of saying, gives all parties “a fair shake.” Frank Galvin lives for those moments. These moments push him to overcome his chief demon: a nagging sense of capitulation to the idea that the system <i>doesn’t</i> work. With his faith rewarded, I can see him taking on a few more Goliaths of Boston.</p>
