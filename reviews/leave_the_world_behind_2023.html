    				<p>If in the next day, our phones, computers, and “smart” cars were rendered inoperative without access to the internet, how long would we be able to cope? No one would deny our societal dependence on our devices. The real assessment is our <em>level</em> of dependence. Are we incompetent people without the internet?</p>

                    <p>Most see this clearly: the gears of our world are digital. These changes have happened so quickly and ingrained themselves so deeply that it is difficult to have any perspective. Without functioning digital tools, it is hard for me to grasp what my life would become. <cite>Leave The World Behind</cite> bridges this question of technological attachment with our cultural and political moment. When our attachment to devices and media begin to usurp the desire for interpersonal relationships, what happens when the devices become unusable, yet people remain?</p>

                    <p>That is the predicament of our six main characters, all representing generational slices and cultural backgrounds. Star power from Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, and Mahershala Ali quickly gets our attention. Their reactions when the connection-less moment begins are telling; their actions, particularly those of a thirteen-year-old girl, are defining.</p>

                    <p>To unnerve the audience with the weird things happening in plain sight, director Sam Esmail uses multiple techniques: music and sound that overwhelm our senses, a camera that spins and pans (often all at once), and scenes that intercut between characters stressed by different situations. I was surprised by certain cinematic quirks like how many zoom shots are present in the film and the framing of vertical action in unexpected ways. Not all of it worked, but I particularly liked how rarely Esmail uses a close-up. When it happens, it is meaningful in the scene.</p>

                    <p>Peculiar and astonishing things happen in <cite>Leave The World Behind</cite>, but that is not what sticks with me. The film’s narrative exposes deep vulnerabilities in our society. Folks can nitpick the veracity of the events shown in the film, but they miss the point: is there a price to pay for the relentless pace of technological innovation that we have embarked upon? </p>

                    <p>In an interconnected world, no one has to invade us anymore. If our internet connections and our communication infrastructure are sent offline, do we have a back-up plan? In that disconnected and information-less period, how long would it take before paranoia and suspicion cause the people of an already fractured America to turn against each other? Unable to drive anywhere because of hacked, self-driving Tesla cars and horrified by “the noise,” people will begin to believe it is my family or yours. Then, it is either my country or yours. </p>

                    <p>Shockingly, <cite>Leave The World Behind</cite> suggests the atom bomb is not the worst weapon of mass destruction. If that were true, the final images of the film would be the skyline of New York City, the hallmark of America besieged by civilian infighting, terror, and two mushroom clouds. So, what is the worst weapon? </p>

                    <p><cite>Leave The World Behind</cite> picks at what it sees as mainstream in today’s culture: the easy capacity to distrust, criticize, and be cold. If it happens so often in online exchanges, how could it not bleed into conversation and important relationships? One night, Rose (Farrah Mackenzie) has a demeaning conversation with her brother (Charlie Evans). Because no one in her family makes her happy, she decides to take her fate into her own hands. Without telling anyone, she runs away. In a neighbor’s home, she finds a perfect disaster bunker during a crisis. Devouring junk food, Rose’s first inclination is to enjoy the last episode of <cite>Friends</cite> that she has been dying to see, rather than bring her family in the middle of apocalypse. The final image is a thirteen-year-old girl made whole by her newfound ability to watch <cite>Friends</cite>. A TV show makes her happier.</p>

                    <p>The ruler of a technology is the one whose code runs on it. Most of our technology is not our own. <cite>Leave The World Behind</cite> tells us: If we use technology to replace the value of human connection, then we better understand the consequences – and what now has control over us. Doctor, the patient’s diagnosis is not good.</p>
