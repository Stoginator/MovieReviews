    			<h1><i>Jurassic World</i></h1>

    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Yesterday, I saw <i>Jurassic World</i> in IMAX 3D at Cinemark Pittsburgh Mills. It was a blast and defied my expectations of it being a similar <i>Jurassic Park 3</i> let down. The director, Colin Trevorow, has made a movie that has action sequenced so similar to Spielberg's <i>Jurassic Park</i>, many probably made the mistake that the movie was actually directed by Spielberg who served as an executive producer on the film.</p>

    				<p><i>Jurassic World</i> is based on the similar topics that run through the series veins: corporate greed and the desire to create something "great." 20 years after the events of Jurassic Park, John Hammond has passed away and given his discoveries to billionaire Simon Masrani who has opened a theme park on Isla Nublar. When a new dino being genetically engineered by scientists to satisfy tourists' ever growing desire of bigger, badder, and scarier, things get out of hand. Owen (played by Chris Pratt of <i>Guardians and the Galaxy</i>) is called by Maserani to break through the dino's way of thinking. On Owen's way, he runs into Claire, the operations manager, who introduces him to the dino named the Indominous Rex, a breed of a T-Rex and other classified animals. Claire's two nephews are also over for the week, and from the exposition, things very quickly fall out of hand.</p>

    				<p>The movie had great action sequences, and had references to <i>The Lost World</i>. While the characters were very enjoyable to watch together on the screen, the movie did not focus enough on Owen to round him out thoroughly enough. On the other side, Claire is very thought-out and turns out to be a highlight.</p>

    				<p>The technological aspects of the film are some of the best parts. The movie was shot in 2.00:1<sup>1</sup> which is a bit smaller than 1.90:1 aspect ratio of all IMAX digital auditoriums to fill up the screen. As always, the sound was earth-shatteringly loud and a dinosaur has never sounded so good since the original <i>Jurassic Park</i>. Though, the 3D as usual proved to have a more negative impact than positive. It as always darkened the image considerably and made the movie feel like a burden at times.</p>

    				<p>The plot of <i>Jurassic World</i> has close ties to the original which most will likely catch on to. The same topics and themes resonate throughout the movie, but the characters of <i>Jurassic World</i> fall short of the greatest of those in <i>Jurassic Park</i>.</p>

    				<p>All in all, if you loved the original like everyone in human existence, you are gonna at least like this one too.</p>

    				<p>[1] This was corrected from the originally written aspect ratio of 1:89:1.</p>
