    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh are two of Hollywood’s preeminent stars. Garfield has an established acting career, with his memorable work in 2010’s <cite>The Social Network</cite> and 2016’s <cite>Hacksaw Ridge</cite>. Pugh is newer, yet just as capable; in a short time, she has become a Gen Z favorite with roles in 2019’s <cite>Midsommar</cite> and 2023’s <cite>Oppenheimer</cite>. Their selection of projects leans artistic, often bringing fresh perspectives to the screen. When I heard Garfield and Pugh were leading a romantic drama <em>together</em>, I booked my tickets, no movie trailer necessary.</p>

                    <p>Garfield and Pugh’s combined history of films suggests that their newest film, <cite>We Live in Time</cite>, would feature a unique angle on the most familiar, Hollywood genre. You would expect that, behind the casting of two great actors, there lies a satisfying reason for the project to exist. What are the filmmakers’ intentions? Why did they spend years preparing this romance for us?</p>

                    <p>Garfield plays Tobias, a <q>Master Data Steward</q> at the company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weetabix">Weetabix</a>, a producer of wheat biscuits. As an information technology specialist, he is an extremely logical guy, with a preference for facts. In the beginning, Tobias is afraid of a calculation in his head: there may be more of life behind me than in front of me.</p>

                    <p>Pugh plays Almut, a Michelin-star chef with a competitive streak. She is an open book with her previous relationships, confident in her physical appearance, and honest about her desires. Almut is motivated to be the best in her field of cooking. She wants to live her best life – and Tobias is her key.</p>

                    <p>Garfield and Pugh are the highlights of the film, playing characters that tend to contradict themselves, in a way that real people often do. Almut is a closed book on a particular part of her life story. Tobias tends to process events logically, pushing his emotions under the surface. But when they rise, they come out <em>big</em>. Their dialogue sounds deliberately un-scripted, which makes it feel like we are gazing at this couple through a window.</p>

                    <p>Nick Payne’s screenplay develops Garfield and Pugh’s romantic relationship using a nonlinear structure. <cite>We Live in Time</cite> is built on sequences, defined by important moments in their characters’ lives such as life before meeting, life after meeting, and life while dating. You may see one sequence while the couple are dating followed by a sequence of the two before they met.</p>

                    <p>It is an interesting, uncommon wrinkle to the romantic formula. Our usual expectations of romantic structure are thrown off. Before this was clear to the audience, there were some surprising events early in the film which made me lean forward. However, I soon leaned back. It takes more than unusual structure to make a great film.</p>

                    <p>Why did two of the world’s best actors take on this project? They wanted to put a more realistic take on romance up on the screen. <cite>We Live in Time</cite> shuns the Hollywood glamorization of love, opting for a representation of practical, modern romance. Melodrama is avoided at all costs, with its exaggerated displays of anger or sadness. The film’s dialogue is painstakingly modern, adapting the ways that real people talk. The film is a vibe – a recognition of the world that couples navigate in the real world. As a time capsule of social mores, this film will be very interesting to see in fifty years.</p>

                    <p>The film has some flourishes of Hollywood when something very unlikely happens. Even though these accidents are the film’s best moments, <cite>We Live in Time</cite> sticks to elevating everyday life, using baths, parallel parking, dinner parties, and nighttime fun as the background setting for the film. This decision works for and against it. I loved seeing the happy accidents that only happen in the movies. There is one larger-than-life scene that I will always associate with this film. The couple’s domestic struggles felt dull in comparison.</p>

                    <p><cite>We Live in Time</cite> feels like a memory, a jumble of events and feelings that return in pieces. Its nonlinearity reduces the story to a collection of sequences. Many of the sequences are memorable. Some are great. But there is no closure – no satisfying ending – that stitches the experience together as one final expression. That may have been the filmmakers’ intent. In this case, however, the whole is not more than the sum of its parts. Tobias would appreciate the expression.</p>

                    <p>When I left the theater, I thought the film ended prematurely, as if there was one last scene that satiate my desire. By not providing closure, it seems like the filmmakers are trying to replicate a feature of life: You can’t count on life to whack you over the head with meaning; you must discover it yourself. That may be the defining takeaway of <cite>We Live in Time</cite>.</p>

                    <p>I expect different reactions to <cite>We Live in Time</cite> as it is an experiment in blending real-life romance with Hollywood love stories. I found the film’s final statement cliché and obvious, but the girl sitting next to me was in tears. Touché.</p>

                    <p>The artistic takeaway of <cite>We Live in Time</cite> seems very clear to me: Hollywood does best when it embraces a tug of war between fiction and reality, especially in romance films. Hollywood romance films show an arc of change in a character: how someone becomes something, when it was so unlikely at the beginning of the story. Our hands are held through these small changes, so when the transformation finally appears, it makes emotional sense – and we fully believe it.</p>

                    <p>This is what makes Hollywood romance so satisfying: how many venture capitalists do you know who would fall in love with a call-girl like in 1990’s <cite>Pretty Woman</cite>? How does a sardonic narcissist become a generous person and win-over the loveliest lady in 1996’s <cite>Groundhog Day</cite>? How does a high school freshman woo a twenty-five-year-old girl who he is utterly infatuated with in 2021’s <cite>Licorice Pizza</cite>.</p>

                    <p><cite>We Live in Time</cite> has an arc of change, but it is not the center of attention nor is it particularly meaningful. In real-life, people tend to not experience these types of changes – which makes it hard to fit in to <cite>We Live in Time</cite>, which prefers the give-and-take of relationships. However, if you strip a romance of this arc of change, it will dull the emotional core. The romance film needs a suitable replacement. Without one, when the audience reaches the film’s ending, we are left wanting for something more.</p>
