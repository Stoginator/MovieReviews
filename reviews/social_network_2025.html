                    <p>2010’s <cite>The Social Network</cite> is commonly recalled as the “Facebook” movie. The filmmakers couldn’t disagree more. In a 2011 interview, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, <q>This isn’t a biopic and it’s not a profile of Mark Zuckerberg. It’s a story about a lawsuit.</q> It may sound like corporate legalism to avoid potential libel cases – but the filmmakers were heavily attracted by more than just a “Facebook” movie.</p>

                    <p><cite>The Social Network</cite> tells a Shakespearean tale of two best friends whose relationship is torn apart by a new software venture, which <em>happened</em> to be the most popular social networking platform of the 2000s: Facebook.</p>

    				<p>Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the co-founder of Facebook at a fresh 19-years-old, is the protagonist of <cite>The Social Network</cite>. The film plays in flashback against a frame story of two lawsuits against Zuckerberg. One comes from his classmates Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The other is from co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). There are unreliable narrators all around. Both lawsuits are used to unravel the story, yet the film’s central caveat is clear: <b>Whose version is the truth?</b></p>

                    <p>In Hollywood, the rule of thumb is one page per minute of screentime. Aaron Sorkin’s shooting script is 163 pages, but the final cut of <cite>The Social Network</cite> is just under two hours; the way he heard the dialogue in his head was <em>rapid</em>. To fit 163 pages into two hours of screentime, the film’s director, David Fincher, had to hit all his marks: establish setting, build character, and convey dialogue coherently. What does that make a director do?</p>

                    <p><em>Collaborate</em>. Fincher had a precise vision for <cite>The Social Network</cite>, yet he pushed his screenwriter, cast, and department heads to their creative limits. To paraphrase Jesse Eisenberg, Fincher thought about everybody’s job more than they did. <em>Everything</em> in the film is deliberate. You can pause and sift through the layers to find a satisfying core. But make no mistake: the primary experience of watching the film is absolutely thrilling.</p>

                    <p>As the Columbia Pictures logo fades in, <cite>The Social Network</cite> opens with a stirring guitar. A drum riff starts. Ambiance from a bar fades in. Then, the now-famous opening line from actor Jesse Eisenberg’s portrayal of 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg plays in voiceover:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MARK (V.O.)</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Did you know there are more people with genius IQ’s living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><cite>The Social Network</cite> is ferocious in its delivery, enveloping the audience in a cacophony of elements that the opening seconds foreshadow: a guitar, a competing drum riff, loud bar ambiance, and aggressively paced dialogue. The opening line itself is a storytelling hook, commonly seen in an op-ed. Taken together, this mixture has a subconscious effect on the viewer. It is the cinematic equivalent of saying, <q>Strap in, because this is gonna be a wild ride.</q></p>

                    <p>When <cite>The Social Network</cite> is playing, its magnetic pull evades filmmaking analysis. Once its spell is cast in those opening seconds, you can’t look away until the end credits. How was such a feeling conjured by filmmaking wizards?</p>

                    <p>It begins with great material in Aaron Sorkin’s Oscar-winning script, which had all the seeds of a compelling story: conflict between old money and new money, accusations of impropriety, uncertain loyalties, a desire to attain higher status, and betrayal between friends set against a modern backdrop of software entrepreneurship. That attracted David Fincher, whose directorial process is unique.</p>

                    <p>Fincher brought on his filmmaking team: casting great, young actors to drive the film, hiring production designers and set dressers who recreated Harvard dorms as a set, a photography team who developed a distinctive visual look, and terrific post-production staff.</p>

                    <p>In pre-production, Fincher and Sorkin spent three weeks in rehearsals. They workshopped the script with the main cast, finding the character motivation behind each sentence while finessing the cadence. In these three weeks, Fincher tested a Sorkin script like few had before, suggesting changes that made the dialogue punchier and more memorable. Fincher became Sorkin’s best friend and biggest challenger. Together, they developed gems like this:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">SEAN PARKER</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">This is a once-in-a-generation-holy-shit idea and the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold. Look at my face and tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Imagine being an extra on set to film the opening scene of <cite>The Social Network</cite>. The two actors with speaking parts, Rooney Mara and Jesse Eisenberg, performed the entire five-minute scene <b><em>99</em></b> times. After each take, Fincher gave notes to the duet to accentuate or hit a certain mark. Now, extend this practice to every scene. Fincher was assembling a war chest of options in the cutting room.</p>

                    <p>Editors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter received 268 hours of camera footage across the entire production, which needed to be trimmed into the best two-hours possible. Once they had an “assembly cut,” Fincher and his editors went scene-by-scene and found the best versions of everything: facial expressions, eye movements, vocal tones, word utterances, and even magical syllables. With modern technology, sound designer Ren Klyce spliced different audio tracks over the best camera footage. It’s miraculously invisible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Usually in a sound mix, filmmakers prioritize sonic clarity of the dialogue above all. In <cite>The Social Network</cite>, Fincher brought in the noise to engage the audience. Add the dialogue and sound effects (e.g., hard drives whizzing, glasses clinking), tune up the ambiance (e.g., a bar crowd or street cars), and layer in the music. These bold artistic choices let the audience get completely lost in a story with already outstanding fundamentals.</p>
                    
                    <p>Composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross produced an iconic set of themes. There are so many because they each have a specific resonance in the story. <cite>Hands Cover Bruise</cite>, which plays after the opening bar scene, is a beautiful marriage of story and mood. It helps us empathize with a character whose flaws are clear-as-day. Mark was just dumped by his girlfriend, but those <em>BRRRRR</em> sounds in the track cement the story as a tale of how he will overcome the shame he feels – <em>by any means necessary</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p><cite>The Social Network</cite> was the general audience’s first look at entrepreneurship in the digital age. Traditional businesses are limited by the movement of goods or the actions of people; they grow by single or double digits. Software companies grow exponentially. Using the internet, Facebook signed up over 650 users in its first day of existence, an unprecedented level of growth for businesses outside software. A Winklevoss twin remarks on the earth-shattering nature of this phenomenon:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">TYLER WINKLEVOSS</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">If I were a drug dealer I couldn’t give free drugs to 650 people in one day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, <cite>The Social Network</cite> mythologized the origin of one of America’s most successful technology companies, but the facts remain murky. In the film, real names, locations, and situations are mixed in with movie sets and dramatizations. From a journalistic perspective, it is difficult to discern reality from fiction. Creative license is built into the film; Sorkin’s dialogue offers an admission of this dilemma to the audience.</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I’m not a bad guy.</li>
                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">MARYLYN</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I know that. When’s there’s emotional testimony I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.</li>
                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">And the other 15%?</li>
                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">MARYLYN</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After the film concluded, I couldn’t wash off the core idea that motivates the dramatic character of Mark Zuckerberg. He goes to the most elite university in the world, yet he does not sit at the “cool kids table” when he arrives. He desperately wants to belong to a Harvard Final Club.</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I’m saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.</li>
                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">ERICA</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Why?</li>
                        <li><br></li>
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">Because they’re exclusive. And fun and they lead to a better life.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mark is obsessed with status, especially the fact that he doesn’t have the highest type. In the opening conversation, Mark incessantly rambles about the prestige of Final Clubs. In the way he speaks, Mark condescends towards his girlfriend, Erica Albright, who he sees as lower on the totem pole than himself. Rather than making a date night pleasant, Mark turns it into a verbal competition. Eventually, Erica reaches her limit and shreds him:</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">ERICA</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">You’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That was the last time Mark ever brought up Final Clubs in conversation. Instead, he internalized his desire to prove everyone wrong. He would make his own Final Club, where he is the kingmaker. The whole world would see the new totem pole.</p>

                    <p>While Mark doesn’t openly speak about his deepest desires again, he belittles characters that he envies. When Eduardo gets punched (i.e., invited to audition) by the Phoenix Club, Mark says:</p>

                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">It probably was a diversity thing but so what?</li>
                    </ul>
    			     
                    <p>To stem the tide of his feelings, Mark spends all his time working on Facebook. His actions mask deep feelings of inadequacy, which is rooted in two questions:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Why can’t I get into a final club? </li>
                        <li>Why doesn’t Erica Albright like me?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Mark’s quest begins with humiliation. It ends at the pinnacle of success. All he did, all the wealth earned, all he became to the world – none of it erased the inadequacy that he felt in his core. His tragic flaw is that he feels he must belong to the most exclusive club. While his insecurities made him the world’s youngest billionaire, they ended every positive relationship he had.</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">EDUARDO</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I was your only friend. You had one friend.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <figure class="inline-photo">

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>At the end of the film, The Beatles’ song, <cite>Baby You’re a Rich Man</cite>, plays as the camera pushes in on Mark, who sulks in his chair. The lyrics describe his predicament:</p>

                    <p><em>How does it feel to be<br>One of the beautiful people<br>Now that you know who you are<br>What do you want to be</em></p>

                    <p>Here is someone who <em>won</em> the game. He is a world-famous icon of entrepreneurial success. In a deposition, when a lawyer questions him about his Final Clubs OCD, he says:</p>
                    <ul class="script-list">
                        <li class="character-name">MARK</li> 
                        <li class="dialogue">I could buy Mount Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club, and turn it into my ping pong room.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Yet he doesn’t feel his success the way the Beatles sing about. Instead, the film ends with Mark sitting with his laptop, waiting for Erica Albright to accept his friend request on Facebook. He remains fixated on a girl who rejected him. Why?</p>

                    <p>Because even though he made it to the top, he can’t stand the fact that someone out there won’t accept him into her club.</p>
