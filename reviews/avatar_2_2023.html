                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>James Cameron’s <cite>Avatar: The Way of Water</cite> is <cite>Little Miss Sunshine</cite> meets <cite>Avatar</cite>. At the core of this story is a conflicted family, each pulling in different directions but always bound to come back because of their collective belief: “Sullys stick together.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Intensifying the threads found in the first film, <cite>Avatar: The Way of Water</cite> is a raw movie. Its fantastical location on Pandora and beautiful visuals hide a tight focus on family and on connecting and protecting what all Nav’i believe in: the “Great Balance.” That you must preserve the harmony of the world and live with awareness of all around you. As an audience member, you grow to value the balance. As the family explores more and more, the visceral nature of their experiences left me awestruck and inadvertently in tears. The beauty that has been created in this world is simply unmatched in any fantastical film. It has opened up a new place in my heart that motivates me to savor the Earth and protect it.</p>
                    
                    <p> When things are thrown out of order, when harmony turns to discord, the imbalance is palpable. Jake repeats a famous line, “The people say that all energy is only  borrowed and one day … you have to give it back.” There is a reason that these films connect so broadly all over the world - across ages, nationality, religion, and culture. There’s some things that we yearn for in our own lives that are represented in this film. It taps into our human desires for meaning, for nature, and for togetherness. Its box office is raw evidence displaying that humans pine for the same things. “I see you” are the words each of us yearns to hear.</p>
                    
                    <p>This film stayed with me. Its palpable emotional resonance was intact long after my first viewing. Certainly, it is unlike any experience I have had in a movie theater. On a personal note, it values what I do: the tight bonds of family, taking care of your home, living in harmony. I know other people from different walks of life feel this same way - I felt like my beliefs were shared on screen. And because it connected with me in that raw way, that resulted in my reaction. </p>
                    
                    <p>I get this family. Lo’ak’s desire to live up to a high bar set by his father, Kiri’s desire to know why she doesn’t fit in, Tuk’s desire to go home. I get these feelings. I get Jake’s desire to run to protect his family and Neytiri’s desire to fight to protect her people. Where this film resolves each of these strands is absolutely wonderful: “I see you.” As I have noticed in Hollywood these days, this story is actually the kids’ story. I expected to love the continuation of Jake and Neytiri, but what I loved more was seeing the growth of their kids. I am committed to the journey ahead.</p>
                    
                    <p>This film has stakes. That is the calling card of Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa, writers who worked on <cite>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</cite> (which was its own high-stakes tale). No one feels safe in these movies. The threat of the “Sky People” - of us - to the harmony is omnipresent. It is unsettling to see our species’ worst demons consistently shown - so much so that we are called “Demons” by the Nav’i. But, what we do is so believable because we have done it many times before.</p>

                    <p>All of the sequels have been written in conjunction with each other from the beginning of <cite>Avatar 2</cite> to the end of <cite>Avatar 5</cite>. If this film is any indication, Cameron did it right. The future of this franchise is massively exciting - big budget Hollywood spectacle with real stakes and a real emotional core. The thematic threads, the evolution of characters, and the world of Pandora - all will be fascinating to look back on at the conclusion of this series.</p>

                    <p>James Horner’s contributions to film are beloved where I come from. His absence is all the more saddening on an epic canvas like this. That gives all the more credit to composer Simon Franglen, whose music is less melodic and more textural. Its new elements - voices, drums, and even better use of violins - fit in with our exploration of Pandora while its callbacks to old melodies come at the right times.</p>

                    <p>And, of course, the technical feats of this movie are simply astonishing. They all merge in service of the experience, the story, and the characters. The fidelity of the water, the animals in the sea, and the facial expressions are second to none. This is the best use case of performance capture the world has ever seen. The high frame rate shifts were fleetingly noticeable and work well in these CG environments. Each Avatar has a special place on the timeline for the history of CGI. With the next film in the hands of James Cameron, I am impatiently waiting to see more of this world and discover new places in my heart.</p>

                    <p class="section-quote"><cite>Avatar: The Way of Water</cite><br>has earned commendation as one of my favorite films of all time.</p>

                    <i><u>Note</u>: I viewed this film twice in 3D - the first time in a Dolby Cinema and the next time in an IMAX theater. Both were projected in 48 frames per second and resulted in a very immersive and impressive experiences. The underwater sequences were simply wonderful.</i>
