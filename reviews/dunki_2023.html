    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>At the end of 2022, I learned that India’s best director, Rajkumar Hirani, and India’s biggest movie star, Shah Rukh Khan, were collaborating on a new Bollywood film called <cite>Dunki</cite>. I became extremely excited: Hirani makes unique films for Indians, always embedded with social commentary about India. In 2004’s <cite>Swades</cite>, Shah Rukh Khan made a great film about one man’s transformation as an Indian-American who returns to India after many years. His best performance came in a statement-film – a type of film he rarely adventures into. Paired with Hirani for the first and perhaps only time, I wondered if that underused side of Shah Rukh Khan could be found once again. There were high hopes for this film.</p>

                    <p>Shah Rukh Khan plays Hardy, a soldier in the Indian Army who was wounded during active service and saved by a bystander. Hardy makes it his mission to help his savior’s family and friends, which becomes helping them immigrate to London. Working dead-end jobs, lured by images of riches, and unable to obtain legal visas, Hardy decides to use the dunki route from India to the United Kingdom to immigrate illegally.</p>

                    <p><cite>Dunki</cite> is never boring. I did not leave the theater disappointed, but I felt that <cite>Dunki</cite> was ultimately unsatisfying. It did not reach the heights of Hirani’s previous films, his two films about Munna Bhai or 2010’s <cite>3 Idiots</cite>. Dramatically speaking, <cite>Dunki</cite> is very similar to 3 Idiots, so why is it not as effective?</p>

                    <p>Embedded in all of Hirani’s films, there is a deep-cutting statement about Indian culture that, no matter your point of view on the subject, feels truthful and powerful. That commentary is manifested in our minds by the characters and their situations, which are often dramatic and funny. Without being on-the-nose or didactic, Hirani uses memorable stories, instead of editorials, to send a message. Hirani’s filmography represents the kind of movies that are exciting to watch and re-watch. We are so enthralled by the characters that the audience makes the leap in drawing connections from art to life. Hirani’s social message becomes self-evident.</p>

                    <p>In <cite>Dunki</cite>, his message is conspicuous: Immigration control only bars out poor people. Unlike his previous films, Hirani makes his social statement explicit, rather than implicitly representing his commentary as obstacles to his characters’ desires. There is a big difference: if you start from character and build a story that naturally reflects a message, the audience will be entertained. If you start from a message and build characters and a story to make a statement, the audience will resist.</p>

                    <p>Hirani’s explicit commentary breaks a cardinal filmmaking rule: it is the job of the audience to understand the subtext around a story. Especially with <cite>Dunki</cite>’s subject matter, audiences are living, seeing, or reading about migration. Hirani needed to trust that the plight of his characters would be recognized by the audience as a widespread social issue.</p>

                    <p>Because of this change in mechanics, <cite>Dunki</cite> is less affecting than it could be. Many events in <cite>Dunki</cite> happen too conveniently and coincide in a way that seems unbelievable. The motivation for taking the dunki route is too much to process – with a friend who learns that he failed the English exam, receives a phone call about that his great love has committed suicide, and then burns himself alive. Quite a lot happens very quickly which undermines the trauma of the dunki itself.</p>

                    <p>The gravity of the subject matter also forces a change in Hirani’s style. With all his films, comedy and drama alternate in dialogue to elevate a social issue that the characters confront. Roughly speaking, the first half of <cite>Dunki</cite> follows this formula. In the second half, except for one small scene, the trek itself is heavy material – which is realistic. For the audience, however, the effect is emotionally jarring because we realize how desperate one must be to embark on this journey. <cite>Dunki</cite>’s second half feels like a completely separate film because it is missing comedy – which we found in the film’s rhythm before the dunki. After the intermission, there was almost no laughter in my theater.</p>

                    <p>Rather than solely using the characters’ situations to express his social commentary, Hirani both dramatizes and fires facts at us – using dialogue and real images of people’s global dunki treks. By using both drama and editorials, Hirani undercuts the weight of his message himself. The use of editorials is something that Hirani’s previous films inherently avoided, but <cite>Dunki</cite> has forgotten.</p>

                    <p>This switch in methodology may be derived from Hirani’s altered view of the audience. The two Munna Bhai films and 2010’s <cite>3 Idiots</cite> are Indian films made for an Indian audience. <cite>Dunki</cite>, on the other hand, is an Indian film made for a global audience. With this film, Hirani broadened the scope of his message from migration as experienced by Indians to migration as a global issue. It is unlike Munna Bhai and <cite>3 Idiots</cite>, which were made for Indians, but can be enjoyed by all. Non-Indian audiences can determine the subtext in those films; many have, and many more will. In <cite>Dunki</cite>, as the audience is global, there can be nothing left unsaid for the audience to determine. In this context, Hirani’s explicit messaging is globally understood, but locally effective.</p>

                    <p>There was a fantastic film to be made here. On the screen, <cite>Dunki</cite> is brimming with potential from Hirani and Khan. Ambitiously, Hirani aimed to make a social statement about <em>global migration</em> with the help of <em>India’s</em> biggest star. That shift in focus is how <cite>Dunki</cite> undercut its own message.</p>
