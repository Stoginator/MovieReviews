                <p><q class="review-subtitle">It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood. A beautiful day for a neighbor. Could you be mine? Would you be mine?</q>- Mr. Fred Rogers</p>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>In my mind, Mr. Rogers’ program serves children best; this film serves adults best. It’s not that there is inappropriate content (the film is rated PG), but its message would be most appreciated by older people - unless there are some truly cynical children out there, I hope not. Show children the television program and leave this film to the hardened adults.</p>

                    <p>Marielle Heller’s film made me smile, not just smile, but break out a full-toothed grin. In my experience, only films that eloquently provide an answer to the age-old question, “What does it means to be human?” pull that off. It came at a singularly unique moment when Tom Hanks expertly wielding the power of Mr. Rogers’ persona looks into the camera with a smile. For those who know the moment, it felt like someone looking at you who genuinely loved you. In that way, it functioned like a microcosm for the film.</p>

                    <p><cite>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</cite> tracks the difficult act of forgiveness - to a time so integral in someone’s past that it has solely defined their character in the present. Even with Tom Hanks’ wonderful portrayal of the wisdom, compassion, and grace of Fred Rogers, <cite>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</cite> is not a film about Fred Rogers. Viewers expecting the story to center around him will initially be disappointed. Instead, the film is about an investigative journalist, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), who is assigned a profile of America’s most beloved children’s television host. Slowly but surely, it becomes a welcome subversion of expectations.</p>

                    <p>The screenplay is a feature-length episode of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood specially designed for adults - to reestablish pieces of our upbringing that we may have forgotten. Sometimes, the film feels like therapy - like it is speaking directly to our hearts reminding us to be thankful, take care of our loved ones, and to remember what is really important. I found the conversations between Vogel and Mr. Rogers to be quite profound. For a lot of adults, Vogel initially channels how they feel about Mr. Rogers, but, through contemplation, interviews, and life assessment, Vogel realizes the gift that Mr. Rogers gives him - that Mr. Rogers gives to all of us. Of course, this worked because of the magnitude of Tom Hanks’ performance. Performance sounds inaccurate, it was much more an embodiment of Fred Rogers. If you close your eyes during Hanks’ scenes, you could believe it was the man himself.</p>

                    <p>Once it firmly establishes its characters, the film has the effect of counseling for adults. The way I see it, Mr. Rogers always remained a child at his core, but he was tempered by the weight of adulthood. He tried to share his love with millions, give back to his community as much as he could, and be a good husband and father. But, as his wife acknowledges in the film, he was not a saint <i>nor</i> was he perfect. The part that affected me personally was that, even though we place Mr. Rogers on a pedestal, he was a human being just like we all are. <q>He has to work at managing his temper everyday,</q> his wife says. From then on, everything Mr. Rogers said and did felt more powerful. Being kind being patient, being grateful are not effortless qualities - but the film and Mr. Rogers argue they are worth the pursuit it takes to attain them. After my time at the movies today, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>

                    <p><cite>Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood</cite> taught children to believe in themselves. Among many things, Mr. Rogers helped them make sense of the world from explaining that they wouldn’t drain down the bathtub because it is physically impossible or that they have inherent dignity just like every person. Naturally, as adults tend to do, they found him suspicious. A child never questions sincerity or altruism; they must learn to doubt someone's good nature. However, a child  naturally questions ulterior motives; for that reason, villains seem confusing to them. Mr. Rogers made sense to children, but he never quite made sense for many adults.</p>

                    <p>I think Ms. Heller’s film accomplishes something immensely great: it encapsulates the meaning of Mr. Rogers’ life. What he meant to the world, what he did for people, how he spoke, how he felt to be around. His existence is felt in each frame - present or not. For that reason and many others, I am very grateful to have seen this and to know a little bit more about a man that assiduously worked for a better future. But, more than that, I think Mr. Rogers would say that this film shows us that we are all valuable human beings and we must work to be the best person we can be.</p>
