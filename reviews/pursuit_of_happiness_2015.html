                    <p>Early on in the film, Chris Gardiner explains to a Chinese man how to spell happiness: <q>It's an 'I' remember, not a y</q> just after he told his son goodbye. This film, in particular, revolves around Chris and his son trying to make a living in San Francisco, where as beautiful a city it is, Chris is preoccupied with more material matters. When you are struggling to provide a better life for your child, <cite>The Pursuit of Happiness</cite> chronicles the extreme lengths we go to provide for those closest to us. </p>

                    <p>In one of Chris' monologues, he recalls getting an "A" on a history test and aspiring to be great. And yet, that just hasn't happened. The feeling we all chase leads us to greatness. One of the very core themes is <q>how everything comes back to us.</q> The film develops this in many ways, the most creative of which is through Gardiner's monologues which provide great insight into who he is. Normally with movies dealing with financial hardship, we tend to expect melodrama, something "Pursuit" strongly is juxtaposed against. It takes on a feel closely tied to real life. And what makes this such a story to tell is the "how" of it.</p>

                    <p>Throughout, Will Smith who plays Chris Gardiner tells his son <q>what to do and what not to do.</q> He finally realizes at a point that he needs to be a better role model for his son: <q>Don't let anyone tell you can't do something because they want to put you down. If you have a dream, you need to protect it,</q> he says.</p>

                    <p><cite>Pursuit</cite> wants to inspire us to conquer our dreams like Gardiner, an extremely intelligent man. When it succeeds, it creates some of the most powerful moments in the film. A motif is how Gardiner runs everywhere showcasing that to get what you "deserve," you have to get your shoulders dirty. And that happiness is something that is momentary, you might have to work for weeks, months, and years to achieve it. But in the moment you do find it, its power transcends you and me and surrounds those around us.</p>
