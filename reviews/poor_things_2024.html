    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Behind the artful and occasionally distasteful veneer of <cite>Poor Things</cite> is a simple coming-of-age story. Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) is a child locked in a woman’s body, steadily learning how to speak, how to act politely, and how to furiously jump herself. Her father known as God (Willem Dafoe) is a bit of a mad scientist, surgically combining species in his home: duck-chickens, pig-birds, and a child-woman. For a devilish creator, God has a good heart for his creations, especially Bella, but he never lets her venture outside their home. When Bella receives an entreaty from a lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn (an electric Mark Ruffalo), she decides to go on an adventure with him, only to learn much about herself and the world.</p>

                    <p>As I have been warned, director Yorgos Lanthimos makes unconventional pictures. To me, Lanthimos seems uninterested in the usual or expected; he prefers the extremities of storytelling as in “If it can be done, why shouldn’t it be?” I suspect that a large influence on <cite>Poor Things</cite> is Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 film <cite>A Clockwork Orange</cite>. If you know that film, then you know that <cite>Poor Things</cite> is often an uncomfortable watch in a crowded theater. </p>

                    <p>However, <cite>Poor Things</cite> is very funny at times. Bella manages to find herself in many prickly situations where her honesty overshadows a conventional desire to hide one’s issues. Taken literally, much of the dialogue is amusing because it feels like a mini satire on period dramas, poking fun at a manner of speaking through ironic dialogue and characters’ quotable enunciation. The film also pushes many unpleasant subjects to the forefront of its story: the ethics of species mixing, prostitution schemes, the male need for dominance, human suffering, and self-destruction. It is that swinging duality between conventionally funny and squirming disgust which attracts Lanthimos – and repels many.</p>

                    <p>If you can get past the pendulum of extremities, then <cite>Poor Things</cite> has much to offer. I am partial to the growth arc that Bella experiences: the good times and bad times that come with freedom. Given the era in which <cite>Poor Things</cite> is set, Bella’s journey is representative of single women who finally left home – when that was not the norm. </p>

                    <p>Bella’s world becomes vibrant as she leaves her London home to see what the world is like. Like 2023’s <cite>Oppenheimer</cite>, Lanthimos shifts from black-and-white to color photography to show a difference in perspective. <cite>Poor Things</cite> imaginatively presents the past, pushing the world into saturated hues of orange, blue, and gray. The common fish-eye lens that presents the clothes, the towns, and the sea give us perspective on what it is like to see so much new for the first time.</p>

                    <p>It is difficult to imagine <cite>Poor Things</cite> without the star power. In particular, Mark Ruffalo does tremendous work as a traditional husband of polite society: eventually depressed, possessive, and hilariously simple-minded. Willem Dafoe is hidden behind a great deal of prosthetics, but he is able to leave us with a lasting impression. Emma Stone completely loses herself in Bella, placing her character’s discoveries about the world in plain-sight and guiding us to the point where she decides <q>Like father, like daughter.</q></p>

                    <p>In the end, <cite>Poor Things</cite> becomes more of a feminist statement than 2023’s <cite>Barbie</cite>. In Bella’s past life as Victoria, she could not bear that she did not control her own body. Rather than play along, she tragically took her own life. Reborn with the help of God, Bella learns to evade the domineering acts of men and eventually overcomes them. Now, she is the ruler of herself.</p>

                    <p>With Bella being the absolute object of desire for two men in her life, they become unable to bear their lack of control over her. Their failure becomes their downfall. Then, Bella happily weds a scientist who truly loves her. Only this time, she has finally ended her cycle of self-destruction by freeing herself – and women.</p>
