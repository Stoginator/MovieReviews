                    <p>Going blind into this experience, one might think it is a conventional buddy movie: two friends go through an adventure together and come out changed on the other side. Describing <cite>Thelma and Louise</cite> this way is true, but wildly insufficient.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Imagine reading a news story about two law-abiding, ordinary American women, a waitress and a housewife, who became outlaws. Robbing a convenience store, apprehending a police officer, and eluding wiretaps. On paper, it is quite an unbelievable tale. On screen, it makes perfect, emotional sense. The impact of this story comes from seeing a transformation occur in these women, at different speeds and in different ways, that eventually brings them to the same place.</p>
                    
                    <p>The characters are enhanced by the believability of their situation. Thelma (Geena Davis), a housewife who is frightened into misery by her husband, and Louise (Susan Sarandon), a waitress who does not take her own advice, are ordinary women trapped by the unspoken expectations of society. Be healthy, be normal, and the single expectation chief among all: be obedient or, more often,  submissive to other men. In ten minutes, their reality is portrayed so vividly - replacing melodrama with awkward humor - that I felt happy that these women were taking a much needed vacation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Who knows how these women became friends? As soon as they joined onscreen, I did not want it to stop. The chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis is wonderful. Their characters’ buddy-buddy dynamic is only aided by their contrasts. Louise is the more experienced, senior buddy and Thelma is the immature lady acting on spur-of-the-moment opportunities. As they begin their journey, it becomes evident how much the authenticity of the story is served by the driving locations, motels, gas stations, and acting extras. I am glad this movie was given the budget to spread its wings with packed highways, beautiful scenery shots, and some seriously awesome pyrotechnics. Oddly enough, when the background is well taken care of, character comes into greater focus. Making it fun, their roles in the relationship do not remain static.</p>
                    
                    <p>Director Ridley Scott has an interest in telling stories with strong, leading women like Ripley in 1979’s <cite>Alien</cite> and Marguerite de Carrouges in 2021’s <cite>The Last Duel</cite>. Scott depicts moments of great tragedy without overplaying the emotions through directorial manipulation. There is a great sensitivity on display to let actions and character speak for themselves. Much of that, I assume, comes from Callie Khouri’s wonderful script layered with all the elements of a great popcorn event: lots of comedy, a steady dose of drama, and a take-home message.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is difficult not to notice the particularly damning portrait of men in <cite>Thelma and Louise</cite>. They all see women as possessions, interested in the hunt and capture, but never the preservation. Thelma’s husband (Christopher McDonald) is a harsh, inattentive, likely unfaithful brat (but a hilariously dumb one too!). Louise’s husband, an Elvis clone (Michael Madson) born three decades too late, seems incapable of truly listening to her. A highway hitchhiker (Brad Pitt) is a womanizer and a thief. The only redeemable male character is the state police detective played by Harvey Keitel. The key difference between him and the others is that he knows Thelma and Louise are not controllable. Staying true to his word, he does not try. He seeks to reason with them because he knows what they are running away from. Unlike the others in their life, he is the only one who will learn a thing or two from their decisions.</p>

                    <p>Like most, I was dumbstruck by the ending. Thelma and Louise would never stop running away, but does it make sense for them to go out without a fight? I wondered why… and then it hit me. When Thelma gives Louise the go-ahead to drive off the cliff, what she really is telling Louise is “I'd rather be out there than here. Plus, I’ve had enough fun, Louise. Hit it.” The final choice of Thelma and Louise is the ultimate expression of the world’s lack of control on these women. It might seem weird for such a scene to make me smile, but it does. Thelma and Louise set themselves free.</p>
