    				<p>Richard Linklater does something in all of his films that must not be understated. With the help of virtuoso actors, he creates characters, stories, and situations that feel incredibly real. It is perfected to a degree that it made me forget for a moment that all dialogue is not written so naturally and does not have such a meticulous flow. Like the movie before it, <cite>Before Sunset</cite> is a cinematic unicorn that improves upon its great predecessor.</p>

                    <p>In this film, Jesse and Celine meet again after nine years. Can you believe it? Let’s be honest, there would be no sequel if they did not meet again; the expectation is there. But, how it happens is utterly unexpected just as it is for these characters. And, just like that, there is a level of elevated engagement with these characters  that immediately sets it apart from the first film. There exists a tangible history and the audience feels it. In fact, at least initially, I was hanging on every word waiting for answers. Answers about where they have been, what they are doing, whether or not they were in a relationship, and, most importantly, what had happened that December in Vienna?</p>

                    <p>The key to this film’s greatness lies in its length. Somehow, Richard Linklater has crafted a film completely based on conversations between two people that also occurs in realtime. Once the movie begins, these characters are either walking or talking, or usually both. On paper, that sounds like a subpar movie. And, therein lies the quality of all of the talent involved from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy to Richard Linklater who have crafted a script that could have been ripped off surveillance audio of real people. The dialogue is raw, repeatedly philosophical, and grounded in details. So grounded, in fact, that Jesse and Celine feel like they live off the screen. We have simply been invited to a meaningful hour of their lives. Believe me, these characters will bring a smile to your face.</p>

                    <p>I was also immediately attached to the film’s visual language which, I noticed, has a sense of omnipresence. Stick with me, the first shots of the film depict every locale in Paris that Jesse and Celine inevitably explore. We are shifted into their perspectives as they meet again, but then the God’s eye view comes back. During their conversations, we see the stolen glances, the gestures that almost landed, and the minutia that makes these characters unique. There’s an element of destiny at work, even if they don’t believe it is real.</p>

                    <p>There is so much debate in both films as to whether there is such a thing as romantic love. Celine, the usually optimistic one of the two, even settles for less, <q>Love sells.</q> As these characters age, they become more cynical. But, <cite>Before Sunset</cite> ends on a undoubtedly beautiful message: love is real and you can share it with someone else. When you find them, make sure to hold onto them. You never know if you’ll ever get the chance again. There is a lot we can all learn from Jesse and Celine.</p>

                    <p>Quality sequels exist because the story and character demand it. If a sequel is made for any other reason, then everything in the film will be met with apathy. I am filled with gratitude that we were treated to another moment in the history of Jesse and Celine, especially a moment that was made with such mindfulness. The result is something that can be considered movie magic. It felt like seeing old friends again. You don’t remember that these were fictitious characters until the credits roll.</p>
