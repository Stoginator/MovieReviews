    				<p>My father raised me on a steady rotation of films. These movies made us cackle and cheer, while their endings pushed us to the verge of tears. Arguably, the most memorable picture in the family collection is 1996’s <cite>Twister</cite>, the gold standard for a Hollywood blockbuster. For us, it epitomizes the perfect film.</p>

                    <p>In 1996, audiences came to theaters to witness a spectacle of destruction. Moviegoers sent the film to #2 on the year’s box office; many bought a VHS copy to enjoy the ride again. My father purchased the DVD. Almost thirty years and four physical formats later, time has not been able to change what made audiences walk out of the theater with a smile during its original release. <cite>Twister</cite>’s characters are endearing, especially the central relationship between Jo (Helen Hunt) and Billy (Bill Paxton), a soon-to-be-divorced couple whose path forward remains up in the air. <cite>Twister</cite> used spectacle to elevate its characters.</p>

                    <p>Because of the history and love for the 1996 film, the premiere of 2024’s <cite>Twisters</cite> brought skepticism in my family. How could another film recapture the magic? When the movie begins, we quickly see some wisdom: the filmmakers are not going to try. Instead, they have forged a new identity that reminds us of our favorite film in a few ways but always remains distinct.</p>

                    <p>The director of <cite>Twisters</cite>, Lee Issac Chung, is a director to watch. My first encounter with his work was 2020’s <cite>Minari</cite>, an autobiographical film about his upbringing on a farm in Arkansas and his family’s attempt to live out the American Dream. With a budget of $2 million, no one could have predicted that his next film would cost $155 million. However, given his proclivity for putting authentic relationships on screen and his love for the Midwest, he was the <em>only</em> choice. </p>

                    <p>In <cite>Twisters</cite>, the audience feels an infectious love for the setting and the people who live there. <cite>Twister</cite> filmed on location in Oklahoma – and the remake doubled down on that commitment. In contrast to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyZxyaa-FfE"><cite>Twister</cite>’s dazzling film score by Mark Mancina</a>, <cite>Twisters</cite> fills the speakers with original country music from the genre’s biggest musicians. Before the film, I never properly engaged with country music, but I blasted the album on the way home. I was particularly entranced by a rodeo sequence that made me add the event to my bucket list. It is welcome news that <cite>Twisters</cite>’ highest grossing theater on opening weekend was in Oklahoma, not New York or California.</p>

                    <p>Lee Issac Chung has the highest regard for <cite>Twister</cite> as the iconography of the original is filtered through the production. Only knowing eyes catch these details, but each one generates a smile. Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) wears a white tank-top like Jo does in the original. Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) drives a red Ram truck, just like Billy. In <cite>Twister</cite>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjQgPpkuF4w">Billy “feels” a green sky</a> to understand where a tornado will form. In <cite>Twisters</cite>, this beautiful moment is memorably recreated – twice! The camerawork and the character interactions innovate on something that was already fantastic. However, <cite>Twisters</cite> never calls attention to its construction, preferring to keep the focus on its most important asset: <em>Characters</em>!</p>

                    <p>Following in beloved footsteps, <cite>Twisters</cite> understands that the spectacle is meaningless without a reason to care. The film introduces two characters whose contrast invigorates their relationship. To Tyler Owens, Kate is an enigma. How does a city girl have such an incredible intuition for tornados that she outperforms professional storm chasers? She can <q>feel the sky</q> and go. To Kate, Tyler Owens is a self-proclaimed <q>tornedo wrangler</q> (misspelling intended), a vapid, country boy that loves his rigged-up truck and has no higher calling. Their dynamic is terrific from the start and only gets better. As the central relationship, it carries the film.</p>

                    <p>What <cite>Twisters</cite> does so well – and what other remakes should do – is separate itself from the original. Musically speaking</a>, the films are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siAHbpRVEKE">worlds apart</a>. No characters from the 1996 film are mentioned or make an appearance. This is wise because the film never gives us a reason to ask, “Why aren’t we just watching <cite>Twister</cite>?” Rather, <cite>Twisters</cite> bets on itself to produce equally compelling and authentic characters. <cite>Twister</cite> began a discussion about the clash between science and instinct – and <cite>Twisters</cite> innovates on it, without the cliché line, “English, please!” It turns out that science and instinct go together better than ever. <cite>Twisters</cite> distinguishing features make us glad we came in. Welcome to the club!</p>
