    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><i>Vroooooom</i>. <i>Vroooom</i>. The sound of a gas guzzling V8 engine has never sounded so good than in James Mangold’s new buddy film <cite>Ford v. Ferrari</cite>. This isn’t the type of racing that audiences are used to from the <cite>Fast and the Furious</cite> series. Crashes are shocking, time is always ticking, and winning is everything. Mangold focuses on the nitty-gritty, real-world meticulousness that it takes to win the most prestigious races in the world.</p>

                    <p><cite>Ford v. Ferrari</cite> centers around two car lovers and expert racers: Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon). More importantly, Mangold delves into their deep relationship with the cars. To them, their car is more than a machine; it must be because their lives depend on it. But, more than that, this is not simply an occupation. It’s the love of their life, and as Shelby puts it, they have never worked a day.</p>

                    <p>Even though the film plays for 152 minutes, the pacing is perfect. Just like the cars are fast, so is the film; the narrative propulsion never lets down. While the film is built around “The 24 Hours of Le Mans,” <cite>Ford v. Ferrari</cite> wants to explore its dual protagonists more than anything else. Bale and Damon’s performances are brilliant because they effortlessly establish an empathetic connection with the viewer. These guys are working-class heroes, especially when they’re juxtaposed with the cruel, shareholder-focused executives they interact with. They want to win Le Mans, so do we. They hate that terrible businessman, well, so do we. Not to mention, being friends and business partners has its share of tough moments. Their passion comes off the screen, and that is an achievement.</p>

                    <p>Unlike the stylistic, adrenaline-pumping chaos that the <cite>Fast and the Furious</cite> franchise is known for, <cite>Ford v. Ferrari</cite> puts real stakes into the racing. You can hear it in the sound - every car has a sonic personality, feeling and breathing differently. You understand it in the direction - Mangold carefully tracks every movement, every gear change, every tap of the brakes, every knowing glance. On screen, Bale and Damon embody their real-life characters. A race is won by making a million small decisions and dealing with their consequences. Time, money, and people count. Things could head south any second. Shelby and Miles knew that; it’s something I learned. Giving how much is happening in some of these scenes, especially the races, it’s amazing how clear every stimulus is. It’s a beautiful use of every tool that film affords. Mangold and the creative team are as expert at the craft of filmmaking as Shelby and Miles were at crafting automobiles. To put it simply, the tension is real.</p>

                    <p>Walking out of the theater, I couldn’t get the noise of the engines out of my head. It’s a unique feeling to be behind the wheel; as Shelby eloquently narrates, <q>There's a point at 7,000 RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It just disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space and time.</q> To be honest, I have never been a “car guy” - they have fascinated me just like anyone else, but I’ve never gone home with a shirt covered in motor oil. Now, though, I can understand why someone would. </p>

                    <p>But, I think, the film’s message runs deeper: <q>7,000 RPM, that's where you meet it. You feel it coming. It creeps up near you. Can I ask you a question? The only question that really matters. Who are you?</q> What are you doing when you feel infinite? When you finish the movie and get some distance from it, the sound of an engine stays - not just because it thrills and excite, but because it means something more. For Miles and Shelby, it was a calling, a sound that carried the weight of their existence. They did great things for the world of cars because they felt compelled to. Nothing meant more than following their path. Ford v. Ferrari poses the question to all of us: “What will you do?”</p>
