                <p class="review-subtitle"><q class="review-subtitle">It's unbelievable how much you don't know about the game you've been playing all your life.</q> - Mickey Mantle</p>
    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p><cite>Moneyball</cite> begins there. For the movie, the quote works on a plethora of levels. Firstly, <cite>Moneyball</cite> isn't the average sports movie, but rather an analysis on baseball with social commentary mixed in. Secondly, the quote represents the main character's internal and societal struggle - <q>I think the right question is, do we believe in this thing or not?</q> - against the pushback of nearly everyone associated with baseball. </p>

                    <p>General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt), cannot compete with 120 million dollar teams with a 40 million dollar payroll. Therefore, he seeks to reinvent it with the help of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale graduate who uses a statistical program to calculate the value of players. Brand says, <q>Your goal shouldn't be to buy players, but to buy wins.</q> Billy's immediately interested, <q>We're card counters at the blackjack table, and we're gonna turn the odds on the casino.</q> </p>

                    <p>Who knew films about numbers and statistical data could become the guiding premises of an entire movie. Moneyball never describes the entire process of Brand's program, but we understand the main idea, and the suspense of "Will it work?" drives this film. It's a wondrous thing to see, literally history in the making.</p>

                    <p>The way Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane is captivating. The more I see this characterization, the more I like it, and it never becomes old. Beane is a sophisticated guy, with a hot-temper, but the film portrays him with a heart that extends to his daughter and her future like all parents. He does not mold quickly to societal pressure, as the film illustrates in many sequences including some with his daughter; he is a risk taker. Throughout the film, he reflects on his unsuccessful MLB run where he began straight from high school for the money and fame. He says he would never do it again. Mainly though, the film examines how Beane reacts to those who seek to undermine the program he has run in Oakland through radio, his daughter, and Athletics executives. The owner of the Red Sox says to him, <q>... the first guy through the wall ... he always gets bloody.... Always.</q></p>

                    <p>Moneyball also has sequences of the real footage of the A's baseball games with a film score behind, and all there is to say about them is that they are some of the most entertaining sequences in the movie. Director Bennett Miller has shown that he possesses a real sensitivity to characters and the situations around them without losing the grounded nature that makes his films so entertaining.</p>
