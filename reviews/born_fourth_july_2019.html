    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>When I think of Tom Cruise, I think of an Hollywood icon. A glamorous action star who I’ve known since the third grade. He’s part of any American kid’s lexicon. I don’t remember what I expected when I began watching <cite>Born on the Fourth of July</cite>, but I know what I think now.</p>

                    <p>By some combination of movie magic and raw talent, I was absorbed from the first shot of the movie in a forest on Long Island. Kids were fighting a make-believe war - something symbolized throughout the film in different scenes. Then came the town’s Fourth of July parade: a salute to America - her ideals and also those who sacrificed to protect her. A car of veterans is passing by the townspeople when some firecrackers go off; one of the soldiers winces as he was frightened from the noise. It’s a motif that Cruise’s real life character, Ron Kovic, does himself in the same parade twenty some years later.</p>

                    <p>Cruise achieves something special in this film. He encapsulates Kovic in a way that only some actors ever portray a character. His essence fills the screen and his eyes fill us with dread, betrayal, and a desire to be loved again. Watch for his eyes. They reveal all.</p>

                    <p><cite>Born on the Fourth of July</cite> succeeds on many levels - none more so than in creating a human story. I remember two lines exactly as Cruise said them. <q>I just want to be a man again</q>, he says drunk and coping. Yes, he means it in the traditional sense, but on a deeper level, Kovic wants to be a human again. There’s only three or four scenes in Vietnam, yet the entire film is shaped by them. Kovic physically lost any control and feeling in his lower body there. But he also lost his appearance as a person like the rest of us. No one looks at him without pity or speaks to him without apologizing. When Kovic came back to the States, he didn’t survive, he was forsaken and left for dead by everyone around. The only connection Kovic was with war vets like him - his family, his high school sweetheart - they moved on. That is, until Kovic finally meets someone who sees him for a human being - the most unlikely individual - a maiden in a Mexican brothel. He had to leave the States in order to fulfill his need for human connection.</p>

                    <p><q>I want to be treated like a human being!</q> he screams in an unlikely place, a Veterans’ Hospital. It was a daily struggle to survive. Kovic believed in honor, duty, country - when he enlisted, those values permeated his core. But, when he returns home, and those values are spat upon, misunderstood, and genuinely met with apathy, Kovic loses his identity. Everything he believed in before he entered the war suddenly disappears, and the haze lifts. He tries to reclaim it, but it is tempered. He faces a divided country either set in their beliefs on Vietnam or too indifferent to bother caring for their fellow Americans. He chooses to do something that would be so antithetical to the man he was before Vietnam: rally against the war. Yet, he does so in a manner that respects America. Kovic shows us his resilience: he hasn’t given up his beliefs even after all that he’s been through.</p>

                    <p>Whether or not Cruise was on-camera, I was engrossed by the cinematography of the film. The camera moves through the environment naturally - depending on the scene. And the mighty close ups of Cruise and others throughout the film, they show us raw, powerful emotions. The elements that make the film are drawn together to create something deeply impacting - that’s the vision of Oliver Stone at play. Look no further than John Williams’ theme which plays across the film. It’s patriotic and foreboding, but it also feels restrained - almost held back from being glorious. The emotional power of the piece is evident in the orchestra. Yet, it is never realized in the brass section, which resembles Kovic’s inner love of country. The two are kept completely separate for a large chunk of the theme, only united near the end - competing until then for dominance. It is an allegory for Kovic’s arc in the film, I suspect, as he tries to reassess where his values fit in the world.</p>

                    <p>Ron Kovic wrote the screenplay with the film’s director, Oliver Stone, with an authenticity and truthfulness that makes you want to avert your eyes and whimper at times. It’s not sanitized - it’s a chapter in American history that still affects us today. It’s a story that we all should hear and learn from about the consequences of war - the scars that war leaves behind in the soldiers who fought them and their families who watch.</p>

                    <p>It is quite sad that Cruise was in a Best Actor category with Morgan Freeman, Daniel Day Lewis, Kenneth Branagh, and Robin Williams. Any other year, it would have been his. But, the trophy, I think, doesn’t matter, just as a medal would not have made a difference to Ron Kovic. It was a legendary performance in 1989 and it is a legendary performance 30 years later in 2019. </p>
