    				<p>When you think of bikers, who do you see? In my mind, it is hard not to imagine burly brutes with ponytail beards, roughed-up denim jackets, and black leather boots. The stereotype has left a large imprint on what it means to be a man; its currents still run strong in American culture. <cite>The Bikeriders</cite> is an open door, inviting us into what happened in one of America’s first biker clubs in the late 1960s.</p>

                    <p>In the opening minutes of the film, writer-director Jeff Nichols plays with our cultural assumptions of bikers. On a dimly lit street corner, we follow Kathy (Jodie Comer) as she enters the traditional smoke-filled bar. A foreigner in this world, she senses the male gaze upon her, becoming distressed as a few men make unwelcome passes at her. Traveling through a maze of people, Kathy finds the friend she came to see drinking a Dr. Pepper. However, not even known company can calm her down; Kathy is so intimidated by her surroundings that she is ready to flee. That is, until she sees Benny (Austin Butler), the most interesting man she has ever seen. In sync with the audience, Kathy’s curiosity vanishes her fear. These guys are not exactly who we think they are.</p>

                    <p>Continuing in the recent lineage of work throughout film and television about Americana, <cite>The Bikeriders</cite> spotlights a misunderstood and under-appreciated corner of this country’s culture - which is the bread and butter of writer-director Jeff Nichols. Any sane filmmaker would likely be petrified at the thought of authentically capturing bikers. If Nichols ever was, I could not sense it.</p>

                    <p>Throughout <cite>The Bikeriders</cite>, there is a pervasive milieu of stylishness. It is quite a dopamine hit to <em>feel</em> the rumble of twenty motorcycle engines and watch Tom Hardy and Austin Butler glide past the camera – all set to the sweet tune of Cream’s <cite>I Feel Free</cite>. It is an incredible cinematic moment, and it fits the bill. Imagine what it must have felt like to be one of them – exploring the open road with a picnic to look forward to and your best friends riding beside you.</p>

                    <p>To the privileged insiders, the Vandals, the motorcycle club explored in the film, bear little resemblance to a regular gang. The Vandals are not corrupted by the usual entrapments that arrive with group power: illegal activities that generate revenue, murder as a solution to problems, and narcissistic behavior that values oneself over the group. There’s no drugs or guns to be found here – just cigarettes, beers, and brothers on bikes.</p>

                    <p>Johnny (Tom Hardy) is their leader, a soft-spoken truck driver with a wife and kids at home. He is the power center of the Vandals, but his selective use of authority is admirable. Benny, the youngest of the bunch, is the renegade; he is an aloof rule-breaker who has nothing but the club. Then, he meets Kathy.</p>

                    <p>Jodie Comer, the actress playing Kathy, may not be as familiar to American audiences as Tom Hardy or Austin Butler… yet. When I saw 2021’s <cite>The Last Duel</cite>, a historical epic based on true events, I was so dismayed by the injustice that Comer’s character experienced that I thought about it for days. That story and her performance left a palpable imprint on my psyche. Comer has been a staple of British television and has only just begun making her mark on cinema. In a welcome surprise, Kathy is the anchor of the <cite>The Bikeriders</cite>, the conduit for the audience to experience what it was like to be on the inside of an exclusive club.</p>

                    <p>The Vandals operate by an unspoken code. If you try to take down a Vandal, the rest of them are coming your way. We sense a deep loyalty towards fellow members and a commitment to honor the group’s name. One man’s behavior is a reflection on all. These bikers are not a bunch of degenerates, but a lovable cast of misfits who have been rejected for one reason or another. They might have family or professional careers, but home is with the club. No matter what’s going on in life, biking is the outlet.</p>

                    <p>That makes <cite>The Bikeriders</cite> unlike most gangster dramas. The others, such as 1990’s <cite>Goodfellas</cite>, are about the destructive uses of group power: stealing to earn your way, lavishly spending to impress, and murdering to protect your pride. At times, it feels as if there is no bottom. <cite>The Bikeriders</cite> strips away the pizzazz to showcase the constructive uses of group power: harboring a safe space, enjoying simple times, and protecting your own. As in any organization, there are indulgences, but they are outweighed by the positive exercise of power. When it is lost, we do not think: Good riddance. Instead, we ask: What could have been?</p>

                    <p>There is a running commentary threaded throughout <cite>The Bikeriders</cite> about two competing versions of what it means to be a man. The ideas are never spoken as dialogue by the characters. Rather, they are expressed through action – and even through what the Vandals never do. One form, whose presence inexorably grows in the club, equates dominance with masculinity. The outsiders, the people who <em>think</em> they know what the club is about, embrace this corrosive idea; its roots do not originate in the Vandals, but the psychology of it in men runs deep.</p>

                    <p>The other idea is that masculinity is about protecting, holding yourself accountable to, and serving those that you love. It is about giving up power. Surely, there are hallmarks of that husky biker stereotype on the surface, but there is something real at the core of this club. Much to our surprise, this purer, more modern version of manhood is what originally permeates the Vandals.</p>

                    <p>Jeff Nichols makes things in movies that are very difficult to do seem easy. In a film that feels so airy and exploratory at times, The Bikeriders makes every moment in the story essential to its telling. Events that seem irrelevant tend to circle back – in a meaningful way. In a sense, the film seems constructed to deliver a common refrain in a refreshing manner: Never judge a book by its cover.</p>
