    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>If you have forgotten what it was like to be in high school, this film will make you remember - at least, it did for me. This film sums up this sentiment that fits its characters and, I suspect, most of those who treasure it so dearly: “We grew up outside of high school because of high school.” We follow a close bunch of kids stuck between four walls of concrete in a system that was designed for “one-size-fits-all” - most certainly, not them.</p>

                    <p>While we meet many characters, <cite>Perks</cite> follows one very deeply. We live inside the mind of Charlie - an ostracized freshman that is conspicuously known as “the weirdo.” Following the unwritten laws of high school social strata, no one wants to say hi for fear of ruining their own reputation.</p>

                    <p>Pity. Quickly, we learn Charlie is emotionally intelligent; one could say he is almost too in touch with his feelings. He knows what everyone thinks and he tries his best in the situation he finds himself in. He’s innocent and honest, bright and aware. The film is cerebral in the way we are shown what he sees or envisions. Throughout, bits and pieces of sequences take place in his mind. They show us his trauma.</p>

                    <p>He knows this about himself. And, courageously, he puts himself out there. He attends a football game by himself and meets two unlikely companions: Patrick and Sam. We are introduced to their rebellious nature, their taste in music, their secrets, their pasts, and their values. But, with these characters, there is something deeper to connect with. What I latched on to were their qualities and flaws. How they embrace the moment; how they take care of their friends; how they don’t always do what is best for themselves.</p>

                    <p>Take a teenager and put them on the rip-ride rollercoaster of high school. Unlike the usual response of desperately trying to maintain a veneer of perfection as a shield under the spotlight of everyone else, Patrick, Sam, and Charlie allow each other to keep it real and take the hardest step at their age - to be vulnerable. To unabashedly be themselves while discovering who they are. That’s where the magic of <cite>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</cite> comes from.</p>

                    <p>This film is not about how people exist on the surface. Anytime the camera centers us on a face, it is trying to see through the surface - sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully. These characters are not defined by a single thing. <cite>Perks</cite> is about the quirks, the idiosyncrasies, and the flawed individual inside. It is about not focusing on what people see us as, and instead fully embracing who we are. It is about coming to terms with the past and moving forward - to be better.</p>

                    <p><q>Do you think if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?</q> This is about a friend group that gives each other license to be themselves. And, the discussions, the happenings, and the shared wisdom make it memorable. There are first times abound - kisses, substances, and relationships. To apply Charlie’s final letter, when the end felt near, the culmination of a series of great moments made me savor the final one. Because of everything that preceded it, the ending is euphoria put on film.</p>

                    <p>Put simply, this is an engaging film that showcases a journey. The detail is staggering. It has meticulously recreated a time and place shared by so many. It has been made with love for its characters, their stories, the places they inhabit, and the very words they utter. Their conflicts feel like ours. Their story feels like something personal. And, their discoveries stay with us. I guess you could say we grew up together.</p>
