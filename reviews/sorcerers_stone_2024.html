    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>In 1977, a titanic film came out of nowhere to rule the box office. It was billed as a spacetime odyssey following a main trio: the chosen Jedi warrior, Luke, the rouge space fighter, Han, and the tough princess, Leia. Watching the first Harry Potter film again, I was reminded of the influence of <cite>Star Wars</cite> on an entire generation of filmmakers like James Cameron, J.J. Abrams, Christopher Nolan, and Chris Columbus. 2001’s <cite>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</cite> is to millennials and Gen Z what 1977’s <cite>Star Wars</cite> is to Gen X. Now, the new filmmakers are coming-of-age whose early inspiration was this trio of wizards.</p>

                    <p>More than twenty years later, <cite>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</cite> has the magical ability to world-build and create belief. The visual effects are kept to the bare essentials with the actors sitting in real halls, classrooms, and train cabins. The cast of children carries the movie along, with the authenticity of their performances bringing out the best of Steve Kloves’s impressive condensation of J.K. Rowling’s book. With an impeccable score from John Williams and imaginative production and costume design, I often sit through large stretches of this film with a smile on my face or tears welling up. </p>

                    <p>Every time I rewatch this film, I am continually finding new things. Out of years of genuine cruelty, how does Harry Potter emerge as the most polite and sensitive boy at Hogwarts? Why is that a given with this character? Also, I wish I had professors that were half as blunt as the Hogwarts team. What happened to sheer honesty in the service of growth?</p>

                    <p>It is a wonderful thing that <cite>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</cite> holds up so well; as a movie geared toward kids, it was a primary influence on my instinct of what good cinema looks like, sounds like, and feels like. Nary a week has gone by where I have not listened to a John Williams score. More importantly, I am constantly reminded of the lessons of courage and friendship present in this story.</p>

                    <p>I wish we all had a Harry, Ron, and Hermione in our lives, an overwhelmingly positive set of role models who balance each other’s worst tendencies and sum to deliver the best in each other. They keep each other honest. Seeing the natural progression of their friendship into what it becomes is always a pleasure.</p>

                    <p>Listening to a John Williams masterpiece and watching the young cast of children, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone feels like a waking memory. Tune up the volume and I feel like I have school tomorrow. It reminds me of an early moment in the film: scared of the wizarding world, Uncle Vernon barks at Harry through the small gate in his cupboard door, <q>There’s <em>no</em> such thing as magic!</q> How in denial is he? In the company of those we love, there is always magic.</p>
