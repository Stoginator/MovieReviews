    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>10 years ago, I was obsessed with 2014’s <cite>Interstellar</cite>. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyc6RJEEe0U&pp=ygUTaW50ZXJzdGVsbGFyIHRlYXNlcg==">the first teaser</a> before 2013’s <cite>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</cite> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LqzF5WauAw&pp=ygUTaW50ZXJzdGVsbGFyIHRlYXNlcg==">the first trailer</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCIipsnorVQ&pp=ygUYaW50ZXJzdGVsbGFyIHRlYXNlciBpbWF4">the IMAX preview</a>, the pre-release marketing was some of the best ever made, leaving us with a million questions and promising an ultimate experience at the movie theater.</p>

                    <p>The project began with movie producer, Lynda Obst, and Cal-Tech astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, in the late 1990s. After years of development at Paramount Pictures with writer Jonathan Nolan and director Steven Spielberg attached, Spielberg left the project. Enter writer-director Christopher Nolan.</p>

                    <p>Nolan worked with his brother, Jonathan, and Kip Thorne to fulfill Kip’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151026153855/http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2014/11/physicist-who-inspired-interstellar-spills-backstory-and-scene-makes-him">vision for a Hollywood film grounded in the latest scientific understanding</a>. Their discussions built the DNA of the film: an emotionally intense space odyssey that is as realistic as possible. All the computer-generated-imagery was developed using Kip’s physical equations. Any of the spacetime events in <cite>Interstellar</cite> are entirely plausible in real-life (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/science/black-hole-picture.html">even confirmed by astronomers</a>). Yet, what Christopher Nolan brought was a focus on how to bring the audience into a brave new world.</p>

                    <p>At its core, <cite>Interstellar</cite> is a family drama stretched between two galaxies. Nolan surrounds that story with our best understanding of high-concept science. How can humans communicate across lightyears of space? What do black holes look like close-up? How does time run differently next to phenomena that are thousands of times the size of our sun? Are ghosts real? However, these questions are ancillary to our enjoyment because the drama of <cite>Interstellar</cite> is so strong. The characters are preeminent.</p>

                    <p>Once an engineer and a pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a reluctant farmer in a world where the food supply is running low. Nothing grows on Earth except corn. Humanity must find a new home and Cooper is the only pilot who can do the job. With two kids, he faces a choice: Do I stay here for my kids or do I leave them to save the world?</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear. And that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe. And that rules out telling a ten-year-old that the world’s ended.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>Nolan and his casting director, John Pasidera, assembled a lights-out cast: John Lithgow, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, Bill Irwin as TARS, Josh Stewart as CASE, and an early look at the future movie star, Timothée Chalamet. Even with that firepower, the stand-out performance comes from a child actress, Mackenzie Foy, who plays Cooper’s daughter, Murph.</p>

                    <p>Murph is a ten-year-old girl who idolizes her father. Her scientific curiosity is starting to bloom. When she learns about Cooper’s potential mission, she personifies the exacting cost of her father’s decision with real potency. The negative force of her performance never leaves us. Just like leaving is a weight on Cooper’s heart, Murph makes it feel like a weight on our hearts.</p>

                    <p>My personal relationship with <cite>Interstellar</cite> has ebbed and flowed. I saw the film on its November opening weekend in an IMAX auditorium. What I experienced was unlike anything I had seen before. After the show, my brother asked me how it was. Searching for words, all I could say was: “<cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> squared.”</p>

                    <p>Throughout the winter, I listened to Hans Zimmer’s original score, going over the images from the film. I could not detach; so much so that <cite>Interstellar</cite> was the first film I saw twice in an IMAX theater. I loved everything about it. </p>

                    <p>However, when the film was released on Blu-Ray, my love started to unravel. My love became an overfamiliarity. I knew every moment of the film. I was most frustrated by how the characters directly speak about thematic elements. Unlike a first-time viewer, I was incapable of watching the film with fresh eyes.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>For years, I downgraded <cite>Interstellar</cite> in my mind, thinking it offered key lessons in what not to do in an epic tale. When the opportunity arose in 2024 to view the film in IMAX for a third time, I walked through the theater doors with an open mind. As it turns out, those years of distance were all I needed to rediscover the magic of <cite>Interstellar</cite>.</p>

                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>On my return voyage to see <cite>Interstellar</cite>, I realized how much groundwork is laid for the film’s powerful climax. To paraphrase producer Emma Thomas, “Christopher Nolan’s films always have the best endings.” But how do you prepare the audience for a five-dimensional Tesseract shown to us in three dimensions? What is it? How does it work? In hindsight, the emotional clarity of the climax is an astounding scientific and cinematic achievement.</p>

                    <p>Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer intentionally threw out the drums, trumpets, and heavy bass lines of 2008’s <cite>The Dark Knight</cite> and 2010’s <cite>Inception</cite>. In their search for a new musical texture, they landed on the church organ, which is the byproduct of a uniquely human calling. Its recognizable sound is mainly attached to emotional backbone of the film, recalling Cooper’s penitence for leaving his kids. Embracing the church organ gives Zimmer significant power with the audience. The creative team does not abuse it, saving the best for last. (Yes, I love <cite><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5aaXqH8rgKZxg61HjECldi?si=ede4902a9252467e">No Time for Caution</a></cite>, but another track is better.)</p>

                    <p>I used to wonder why <cite>Interstellar</cite> was a linear film. What if it began with the rocket launch and intercut stories of Earth throughout the film as Cooper explore another galaxy? That would have been a mistake. If you work backwards from the climax, you see that the entirety of Cooper’s time on Earth lays the film’s foundation. If not seen in order from beginning to end, the climax would not register with the audience.</p>

                    <p>We must understand Murph’s experiences as a child. We have to see those books falling off her shelf - and not understand why. We must be fully convinced Professor Brand’s Plan A could work. We need to witness Cooper’s decision to leave, with one memento to remember him by: a hand watch that he gives to Murph, which she throws across the room in her heartbroken rage. Without those pillars in place, this space odyssey has no emotional relevance.</p>

                    <p>Halfway through the film, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) passionately explains her choice for the next planet to explore. She has a notable conflict on interest: She is in love with the man who landed there years ago. Her response, that once irritated me, now felt natural and earned.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote"><q>Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>This dialogue is the opposite of filmmakers using characters to trumpet their beliefs. Rather, Brand’s line is essential to the story. In the moment, it is a scientist's defense of her feelings. Without it, the film’s development towards the climax in the Tesseract falls apart. If Cooper can push books off of a bookshelf, what difference would it make towards saving the people on Earth? Such a small occurrence would not mean much to humans.</p>

                    <p>While Hans Zimmer subverts his own score in 2024’s <cite>Dune: Part Two</cite>, I found a similar tradition in <cite>Interstellar</cite>. Zimmer does not use musical subversion - but he uses a similar flip in emotion. With <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia3eQ7QD9Z0&pp=ygUVcy50LmEueS4gaW50ZXJzdGVsbGFy">S.T.A.Y.</a></cite>, Hans Zimmer explores Cooper’s guilt. As Cooper pieces together why he is in a Tesseract, he begins to understand why exerting a force across spacetime could be useful.</p>

                    <p>The theme, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbh0kpATAw4&pp=ygUXcXVhbnRpZmlhYmxlIGNvbm5lY3Rpb24%3D">Quantifiable Connection</a></cite>, is key to flipping the narrative: Cooper was not chosen to save Earth. He was sent to space to help Murph save humanity. To use gravity to send data through the second hand of a watch. When he realizes this, he says, <q>They chose her!</q></p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">TARS: <q>For what?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Cooper:  <q>To save the world!</q></blockquote>

                    <p>A loud, rhythmic burst of organ music blared, but its core theme was familiar. Now, Zimmer taps us into Cooper’s elation that Murph is the key. Hans Zimmer’s best theme in <cite>Interstellar</cite> celebrates a familial love being <em>restored</em> through gravity between distant stars. Hence, the name of the film, <cite>Interstellar</cite>, and the opening shot of dust falling on a bookshelf. It is where Murph kept the watch that her father gave her.</p>

                    <blockquote class="section-quote">TARS: <q>Cooper, what if she never came back for [the watch]?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Cooper:  <q>She will.... She will.</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">TARS: <q>How do you <em>know</em>?</q></blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="section-quote">Cooper:  <q>Because I gave it to her.</q></blockquote>

                    <p>As I have briefly shown, these connections are layered across <cite>Interstellar</cite>. If you miss one, you could probably survive the climax. If you miss multiple, you may not get the ending. How else can you illustrate humanity’s best scientific understanding in a palatable way for mainstream audiences?</p>

                    <p>Inside the studios, I can imagine this was a hard sell. But this director has developed his reputation in Hollywood and around the world by betting on the audience time and time again. Nolan is comfortable and aware of how he pushes the audience to the limit of acceptable experience, clear-eyed in his belief that they will make the necessary connections.</p>

                    <p>He is a brave director, for few studios have such full-hearted faith in the audience. It leaves me to wonder: if a studio twisted the arm of a less-prominent director to make the climax less complex, what would have happened? With <cite>Interstellar</cite>’s thrilling climax shown exactly as intended, how many films did we never get to experience so purely?</p>

                    <p>When I watched the ending, I had a massive smile on my face. I see now, after ten years of exploring the world, how easy it is to be cynical. The cynics are louder. They are more accepted as the norm. Being optimistic is unpopular and difficult, especially in a movie about humanity moving off-planet before we die on Earth.</p>

                    <p>I found great comfort in the message of <cite>Interstellar</cite>: Humanity can successfully confront its challenges, when it takes advantage of our most powerful emotion. Hidden in plain sight behind our rockets, intelligent robots, and space stations lies our greatest achievement. It is our capacity to love.</p>
