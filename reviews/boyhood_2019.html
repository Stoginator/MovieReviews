    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Richard Linklater is a storytelling genius. If you were cable surfing and, by chance, you landed in the middle of one of his films, it would seem plotless and airy. You would ask yourself, “What’s going on here?” only to eventually be drawn in to the characters and the “plotless” quality of his films. People in his films (and I use the word “people” intentionally) have simple motivations: earn money, get a girl, provide for the family. But, the point of it all as the main character, Mason, in this film asks his father is to create a world that feels as if life is unfolding before us. We are merely observing the conversations, actions, and expressions of other humans - in this case, a boy who becomes a man in front of our eyes.</p>

                    <p><cite>Boyhood</cite> operates with a simple message which is exposed in a conversation with his father near the end of the film. Mason Sr. says, <q>We’re all just winging it, you know? The good news is that you’re feeling stuff and you gotta hold on to that. It’s true! You get older and your skin gets tougher.</q> It takes multiple viewings to appreciate how those words resonate with so many moments in the film. In fact, the meaning of the film is completely shaped by the last two conversations that Mason has with his parents. It is a fact of life that all adults struggle with and children, who look up to their parents with guarded admiration, struggle to understand until they become adults. </p>

                    <p>The philosophical wisdom of <cite>Boyhood</cite> is rooted in displaying life earnestly. At its core, this is a film about people, and when you observe people enough, you start to relate and see yourself in them. On the surface, all the events in the film have simple, sometimes obvious meaning. But, taken together as a sum, a new, elevated significance is found. We all face the same challenge to find our identity and navigate “the real world” as it is called. Steve Jobs has an amazing quote on finding your path that goes, <q>You can only connect the dots looking backwards.</q> In one sitting, <cite>Boyhood</cite> breathes cinematic life into that quote.</p>

                    <p>I wondered at times whether these characters would be acting differently if the audience could provide third-party advice. Then, I laughed at myself, and then, the awe hit me. In every scene, you just hear the streaks of wisdom that fly by: <q>You don’t want the bumpers. Life doesn’t give you bumpers.</q> At another point, Mason Sr. remarks, <q>Sometimes, a little decisiveness goes a long way.</q> Because Richard Linklater created such a wondrous film, the mission of <cite>Boyhood</cite> seems easy: to tell an almost three-hour movie based on the life of a boy and his family. Linklater achieved the impossible in his trademark fashion by invigorating us in the lives of these people, by understanding their flaws, and, lastly, by realizing that we’re all winging it. Mason, his parents, his sister, his teacher - everyone is, including those we know. It’s a fundamental truth that teaches the audience, including me, about our lives. It’s an amazing accomplishment that is above and beyond the scale of any of his previous films because this one captured the same ensemble cast for over a decade.</p>

                    <p>I cannot give enough credit to Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke who play Mason’s mother and father, respectively, with tremendous sincerity and wicked talent. And, combined with Ellar Coltrane as well as Lorelei Linklater, their film children, they create a lived-in vibe. There’s history and established relationships between everyone and we are afforded the opportunity to spectate. <cite>Boyhood</cite> feels like a documentary, except the fact that it’s not. This film is fictitious drama about the path we take in life, but does that matter? It’s magical.</p>
