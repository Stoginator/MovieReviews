    			<section class="review-text">
    				<p>Could we have a second American civil war? It feels like an idea that Americans are becoming more cavalier about. Comedians joke about it, the media keeps emphasizing our divisions, and some extremists are warning their followers that they should be ready to take up arms at any moment. What do the rest of us – the normies – think? We are split in two camps: <q>Come on, it will never happen again</q> versus <q>I have no clue.</q> Just denial and apathy.</p>

                    <p>Given the movie’s foreboding title, I predicted it would be a timely document about how present-day America fell into a downward spiral, with the story following the new factions growing out of the chaos. While <cite>Civil War</cite> depicts what happens when the rule of law cracks, writer-director Alex Garland forged this story with a much higher purpose in mind.</p>

                    <p>The film is not interested in how a second American civil war materializes; if it was, it would have provided more than a few passing references to how it began. Given how divided America is, it would not be productive for Alex Garland to speculate on how it might happen, just to bet it eventually does. With their perspective, the audience can create that context with a backstory from their own interpretation. Any focus on the causes would take away from the timelessness of the film and instead make it a document of the present moment. If Garland went all-in on present-day extrapolations, audiences in the future will either ask sardonically <q>Can you believe this?</q> or see a story about tragic events that eventually came to pass. <cite>Civil War</cite> is interested in more than a prediction worthy of an op-ed. So, what elevates the material to the level of film?</p>

                    <p>We are thrown into an ongoing war between factions and the U.S. government. The lens we see the conflict through, in a very literal sense, are those of war photographers. They photograph conflict at its origin point around the world, witnessing horrific events unfold in dangerous situations and where the stakes are as high as they get. There are few jobs that are equally fatal.</p>

                    <p>The primary question I faced during this film was: do we ask too much of war photographers? For us back home, they document the world’s atrocities. With that job, there is a cumulative price to be paid, a steep mental toll of trauma. To do the job, they must dissociate from the tragedy right in front of them. But, when they close their heart to human suffering, how can they maintain their own humanity?</p>

                    <p>I was struck by a visual idea that Garland suggests in the film. During a standoff with a sniper in the distance, the protagonist, Lee (Kirsten Dunst), lays her head on the grass. She shifts her focus from the camouflaged men in the distance to the blue and white flowers right in front of her face. For a few seconds, she gazes upon them in quiet contemplation as the sights and sounds fade away. Lee is herself again, a person yearning for a quiet meadow and a hammock, until she mentally returns to the standoff she was in – and the job she set out to do.</p>

                    <p>When you are always surrounded by life-altering events, it is difficult to reflect on yourself. Hell, it is hard for Americans to self-reflect in our normal, everyday life. To photograph conflict, war photographers expend mental resources to stay present and shelve what they see. You can’t search for the perfect shot if you are daydreaming. Experienced professionals have a higher tolerance than newbies. Like all humans, there is a delay between witnessing trauma and processing it. The bill eventually comes due – and when it does, it hits hard.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the film, there are extended sequences of violence that are interrupted by a blast of rock music. It feels like an esoteric, stylistic choice: <q>This music is the opposite of how I feel.</q> Garland needs that contrast, which he finds through rock music, to keep the film watchable. <cite>Civil War</cite> demands it. Otherwise, the film would be too traumatic, without a way to release some of the pressure that builds up inside of the audience. Rock music initially takes the edge off because it begins unexpectedly and then becomes familiar, until the mood of <cite>Civil War</cite> returns and everything feels unsettling again.</p>

                    <p>It felt jarring to see American cities not as places of commerce, cuisine, romance, or the arts, but as active war zones. We are conditioned to see rubble away from our shores, but the psychology of the homeland being destroyed is disturbing. The rule of law has broken down. The streets are empty. There is no trust and no truth left.</p>

                    <p>Why would California and Texas, known as the Western Forces in the film, unite to take down the federal government? My interpretation is those two states represent our extremes on the left and right. In 2010, Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple at the time, told Rupert Murdoch, the man who bank-rolled Fox News, that “the axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive.” When I discovered the lack of a partisan bent in <cite>Civil War</cite>, I thought it was a case of welcome restraint in our polarized times. But, it also fell in line with the idea that, if we do not get things done now, then our extremes will agree that the only way to progress the agenda of both sides is to destroy our institutions.</p>

                    <p><cite>Civil War</cite> is about an America where everyone looks behind their back. In some ways, it is a warning; the constant threat of militias and armed civilians fills the film with raw tension. <q>What kind of American</q> are you? When two opposing factions meet each other in combat, there is no negotiation or offer of surrender. Go in guns blazing, take no hostages, and never engage the enemy – just shoot them. It is an unspoken metaphor of the extreme anchors dominating American politics. <cite>Civil War</cite> greatly benefits from the anxiety that audiences are bringing to the film. Depending on what is to come, I wonder if that sense of threat may affect future viewings of the film, like how less fear of nuclear weapons today blunts the stakes of 1990’s <cite>The Hunt for Red October</cite>.</p>

                    <p>The day after I watched the film, I revisited the soundtrack by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, the composers of every film directed by Alex Garland. The closest, sister soundtrack that it reminded me of is Gustavo Santaolalla’s score for <cite>The Last of Us,</cite> another story where humans have turned on each other. Salisbury and Barrow work in the quiet, preferring stretched-out sounds and minimalism, where the fewest instruments necessary fill the air.</p>

                    <p>As I listened to <cite>Flashback</cite> for the first time, images from the film came rushing back: a man drenched in gasoline and set on fire, a body pit of Americans slain by their brethren, Washington D.C. under siege by militias. After witnessing my country crumbling over the course of the film and never having a moment to process it, the pent-up emotions finally poured out.</p>

                    <p>For war photographers, part of the profession is dealing with the worst sort of emotional trauma, one that is repeated and part of everyday life. It is a horrible business, but a necessary one. The adrenaline rush that comes from being in a high-risk environment and getting “the shot” is mainly what keeps you going. That, and a sense of service that you hope to provide to a grateful world. For them, emotions come in waves.</p>

                    <p>Replicating the suspended emotional state of war photographers on duty, <cite>Civil War</cite> has a delayed fuse. As the credits started, my auditorium was dead silent. I was shocked by what I saw and emotionally exhausted. You might even say that I was in disbelief. After a night of restless sleep, when I revisited the soundtrack, something triggered. Like a wave, I was overcome. Now, I realize that I needed to process the cumulative trauma of this film.</p>

                    <p>I know my experience may sound like a deterrent: Why watch this film if it will just make me sad? You may as well ask: Why become a war photographer if you will consistently be in mortal danger? Sometimes, listening to a friend’s experience can be horrible, but they need to tell us and release their emotions. Like a loyal friend would do, our duty is to listen to them. Garland’s film feels like what sitting in on a conversation between America and a war photographer would be like.</p>

                    <p>Making war photography the primary subject of <cite>Civil War</cite> pushes it away from just being a timely fable and elevates it closer to a timeless document. It is one possible future that America could be inviting. Because of its high-wire act, I accept that not everyone will be able to stomach this movie. However, it is essential viewing. Everyone should try to watch it because it accomplishes what movies do best. It duplicates an emotional experience in such a way that we feel like it could be our own.</p>
