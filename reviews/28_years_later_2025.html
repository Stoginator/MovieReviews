                <section class="review-text">
                    <p>I find the best horror films are the ones where horror isn’t the main ingredient. 2025’s <cite>28 Years Later</cite> works this way. This is the story of Spike, a boy searching for humanity on an Earth where there is little left. Growing up in a world full of infected zombies, he struggles with an idea: “Does goodness still exist?” We recognize, even if Spike is too young to know, that he is battling the early onset of cynicism. Is there anything to take hope in? It is a question for our time.</p>

                    <p>Every film is an economic gamble. The chief financier of <cite>28 Years Later</cite>, Sony Pictures, is betting that a team of creatives will make a compelling story, which returns more than they put in. However, the three big bets behind <cite>28 Years Later</cite> are interesting and unusual.</p>

                    <b>Big Bet #1</b>
                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">Writer Alex Garland, one of the most interesting creatives today</a>, has centered an adolescent as the lead of the film. Director Danny Boyle has cast Alfie Williams as Spike and surrounded him with top-tier talent: Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Ralph Fiennes, and Jodie Comer. This paid off in spades: Without a doubt, Alfie’s performance and Spike’s story are the most compelling parts of <cite>28 Years Later</cite>.</p>

                    <b>Big Bet #2</b>
                    <p>As a mid-budget Hollywood production, <cite>28 Years Later</cite> represents a lost art. Studios used to consistently make films in the fifty million dollar budget range, when home media revenue (e.g., VHS, DVD) and TV rights could guarantee some amount of return.</p>

                    <p>Streaming has hollowed out those revenue streams. The home media market has shrunk from its tall peaks. Studios have responded by producing small-budget movies (less than twenty million) or massive budgets (more than one hundred million). There has been a widespread derisking of Hollywood productions.</p>

                    <p>Luckily for Sony Pictures, their big bet has been a success. With a gross of $110 million, <cite>28 Years Later</cite> has almost doubled its $60 million budget at the box office. That is a winning combination, especially before the value of any sale of streaming rights is added.</p>

                    <b>The Biggest Bet (#3)</b>
                    <p><cite>28 Years Later</cite> is the beginning of a trilogy. Sony Pictures has financed the first two films, awaiting the audience’s verdict before committing to the third. Instead of funding one $200 million behemoth, Garland and Boyle pitched Sony Pictures on splitting a massive-sized budget into three films. That is three attempts at recouping one massive budget, which is a smart, derisking strategy. To the audience’s relief, the sequel is close behind, as it is scheduled for release in January 2026.</p>

                    <p>For brand new or low awareness franchises, this approach is unusual. Historically, studios fund the first film and await preliminary financial results before funding any sequels. In today’s market, funding two films in a low awareness franchise is almost unheard of. Only proven intellectual property gets multiple films greenlit (think <cite>Avatar</cite> or <cite>Avengers</cite>). This series, which began with 2002’s <cite>28 Days Later</cite>, has not achieved widespread popularity. Though, with the quality of this latest entry, I am betting it will break into the culture on streaming.</p>

                    <p>This strategy is Sony Pictures’ first attempt at episodic storytelling in the movie theater. For theatrical exhibition to survive long-term, Sony Pictures understands the need to challenge the audience’s conception of what to expect. <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2024/0220">In a few years, they are deploying this strategy again with something even bigger.</a> If this goes well, expect to see other studios copy it. Exhibitors, producers, and distributors are all watching closely.</p>

                    <b>My Take</b>
                    <p><cite>28 Years Later</cite> opens with a Dutch angle shot of children watching television. At first, it feels like an inaccessible shot. Why is the camera framing this child so awkwardly? The attention that the shot calls to itself is intentional. These kids aren’t watching television. They are afraid of the noises in their home. They are afraid of what lies on the other side of the walls. This is a movie with zombies, but it is not <em>about</em> zombies. It’s about what living in a world with them does to <em>us</em>.</p>

                    <p>Danny Boyle does not make films in the conventional, mainstream sense, yet he finds the same emotions: tension, sentimentality, and adrenaline. Once I understood his filmmaking language in <cite>28 Years Later</cite>, I began to greatly enjoy what it had to offer. My best advice: Expect a conventional story told in an unconventional way.</p>

                    <p>For example, the dynamic range (i.e., the difference between the quietest and the loudest sounds) of the sound mix is deliberately wide. When a door slams, it makes you jump. Yet, the quietest noises make you lean forward.</p>

                    <p>Boyle uses flash cuts where the audience is briefly exposed to an image. This makes the editing deliberately choppy, but it increases the pace. It may be used to enter the imagination of a character or show a different perspective. The explanation of the film’s construction is more complicated than the sequences themselves. When we watch them, it makes perfect visual sense.</p>

                    <p>Still, Boyle finds moments of steadiness to balance it out. Those long-held, visual contrasts linger in my mind:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Zombies standing on top of a picturesque hill during a sunset</li>
                            <li>Two humans standing in the middle of a sunflower field after the apocalypse</li>
                            <li>A pregnant zombie woman walking around, covered in dirt</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>The typical clichés are nowhere to be found. Zombies are around for a reason, the human survivors are worth caring about, and the contrast between these groups is stimulating. The main attraction is actually Spike, a boy who sees demons in the world — in the infected and in the humans.</p>

                    <p>Since the story is told from Spike's eyes, the tone is always authentic: A child sees the world without a filter. Writer Alex Garland exploits this idea to play with tone, which bounces between seriousness, melancholy, and wackiness. Because of this, I never knew where this film was going. I found comedic situations funnier but also felt the intensity of close calls.</p>

                    <p>Films are meant to be self-contained, providing us with a full set of ideas and meaning in a single experience, perhaps with something to consider after it is over. <cite>28 Years Later</cite> is inherently not an isolated story, given its connection to two sequels, which remain to be seen. Part ones which are emotionally complete, like 2001’s <cite>The Fellowship of The Ring</cite>, are rare. <cite>28 Years Later</cite> is more emotionally incomplete, which is one short-term downside of the episodic strategy.</p>

                    <p>Why? When you don’t know if you can return to a story, filmmakers tend to leave it all on the screen. Certainly, with <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> trilogy, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens wrote the first two scripts accounting for that possibility.</p>

                    <p>When you know you will return, you tend to spare ideas for later. When the credits roll, this is why <cite>28 Years Later</cite> feels somewhat unsatisfying. Though, I patiently await 2026’s <cite>The Bone Temple</cite> with enthusiasm.</p>
