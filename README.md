# MovieReviews
A simple website using pure JS, CSS, and HTML to showcase my movie reviews.

As of November 2024, there are 92 reviews on the site. I expect to add at least 1 review a month.

Visit [my site](https://www.tanishsmoviereviews.com) to read them! Hosted proudly on GitHub Pages.

## Achievements
1. **Responsive Design**: Resize the page and have fun. My site is styled for mobile phones and desktops.
2. **Idiomatic HTML**: Each page features HTML written as intended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
3. **Latest CSS**: I used the latest techniques like Grid and Flex! 
4. **Accessibility**: My site was developed with screen readers in mind. Each page received a high accessibility score of 95+ from PageSpeed Insights.

5. **Light / Dark Mode Toggle**: implemented without a flash of unstyled content (FOUC), remembers preference from previous visits, matches OS-default otherwise
6. **Meta tags for each page**: any page and review is sharable on social media, iMessage, or Discord with the site image, title, and description for beautifully rendered links
7. **No web frameworks**: Having used React and Angular, I wanted to design a website from scratch to learn the fundamentals.

## Work Remaining
1. **Watched List**: I am debating how to design an automated system that logs films I watch in chronological order with links to reviews on the site if available. I am not a Letterboxd user, but I am looking into their API.
2. **Performance Optimization**: The home page has lazy loading for most movie card images, but it loads slowly with for users with connections below 1 Mbps. There is a plain review list for very slow connections, but unsure how to move forward otherwise.

## Reference
My work would have taken significantly longer without the aid of Ben Frain's amazing book "Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS." It was a great read and caused a late-night "Eureka!" moment.
