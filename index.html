            <p>Like a lot of folks, I have been enamored by motion pictures for as long as I can remember. After I learned to recognize plot, I began to see more in films: character development, themes, and composition. I loved talking about these things, but I never considered to write my thoughts down. One day, I came across the reviews of Roger Ebert. His plain manner of writing and his reviews’ straightforwardness and simple elegance introduced me to a type of film discussion that is unpretentious and accessible to general audiences. It was a type of writing that encouraged me to use my keyboard as a means of expression. My first review was for Steven Spielberg’s <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, a lovely film. As a kid, watching that movie meant a lot of laughs and a fun adventure. As an adult, I discovered something more: “Indiana… Indiana, let it go.” That inspired me to begin this journey. I hope you can enjoy it, too.</p>
